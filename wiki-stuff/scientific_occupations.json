See subsection.\n\n==Roles and expertise==\n\n===Design===\nEngineers develop new technological solutions. During the [[engineering design process]], the responsibilities of the engineer may include defining problems, conducting and narrowing research, analyzing criteria, finding and analyzing solutions, and making decisions. Much of an engineer's time is spent on researching, locating, applying, and transferring information.<ref>A.Eide, R.Jenison, L.Mashaw, L.Northup. Engineering: Fundamentals and Problem Solving. New York City: McGraw-Hill Companies Inc.,2002</ref> Indeed, research suggests engineers spend 56% of their time engaged in various information behaviours, including 14% actively searching for information.<ref name=\"Robinson (2010) JASIST\"/>\n\nEngineers must weigh different design choices on their merits and choose the solution that best matches the requirements. Their crucial and unique task is to identify, understand, and interpret the constraints on a design in order to produce a successful result.\n\n===Analysis===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-23805-1665, Ingenieure mit Konstruktionsplan.jpg|thumb|Engineers conferring on prototype design, 1954]]\n\nEngineers apply techniques of [[engineering analysis]] in testing, production, or maintenance. Analytical engineers may supervise production in factories and elsewhere, determine the causes of a process failure, and test output to maintain quality. They also estimate the [[time and motion study|time and cost required to complete projects]]. Supervisory engineers are responsible for major components or entire projects. Engineering analysis involves the application of scientific analytic principles and processes to reveal the properties and state of the system, device or mechanism under study.  Engineering analysis proceeds by separating the engineering design into the mechanisms of operation or failure, analyzing or estimating each component of the operation or failure mechanism in isolation, and re-combining the components. They may [[Risk analysis (engineering)|analyze risk]].<ref>Baecher, G.B., Pate, E.M., and de Neufville, R.

Civil engineering, for example, includes structural and transportation engineering, and materials engineering includes ceramic, metallurgical, and polymer engineering. Engineers also may specialize in one industry, such as motor vehicles, or in one type of technology, such as turbines or semiconductor materials.<ref name=\"bls\" />\n\nSeveral recent studies have investigated how engineers spend their time; that is, the work tasks they perform and how their time is distributed among these. Research<ref name=\"Robinson (2010) JASIST\">Robinson, M. A. (2010). An empirical analysis of engineers\u2019 information behaviors. Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 61(4), 640\u2013658. http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asi.21290</ref><ref name=\"Robinson (2012) DS\">Robinson, M. A. (2012). How design engineers spend their time: Job content and task satisfaction. Design Studies, 33(4), 391\u2013425. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.destud.2012.03.002</ref> suggests that there are several key themes present in engineers\u2019 work: (1) technical work (i.e., the application of science to product development); (2) social work (i.e., interactive communication between people); (3) computer-based work; (4) information behaviours. Amongst other more detailed findings, a recent [[work sampling]] study<ref name=\"Robinson (2012) DS\"/> found that engineers spend 62.92% of their time engaged in technical work, 40.37% in social work, and 49.66% in computer-based work. Furthermore, there was considerable overlap between these different types of work, with engineers spending 24.96% of their time engaged in technical and social work, 37.97% in technical and non-social, 15.42% in non-technical and social, and 21.66% in non-technical and non-social.\n\nEngineering is also an information intensive field, with research finding that engineers spend 55.8% of their time engaged in various different information behaviours, including 14.2% actively [[information seeking|seeking information]] from other people (7.8%) and information repositories such as documents and databases (6.4%).<ref name=\"Robinson (2010) JASIST\"/>\n\nThe time engineers spend engaged in such activities is also reflected in the [[competence (human resources)|competencies]] required in engineering roles. In addition to engineers\u2019 core technical competence, research has also demonstrated the critical nature of their personal attributes, project management skills, and cognitive abilities to success in the role.<ref>Robinson, M. A., Sparrow, P. R., Clegg, C., & Birdi, K. (2005). Design engineering competencies: Future requirements and predicted changes in the forthcoming decade. Design Studies, 26(2), 123\u2013153. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.destud.2004.09.004</ref>\n\n==Ethics==\n{{Main|Engineering ethics}}\n\n[[File:Challenger explosion.jpg|thumb|The [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' disaster]] is held as a case study of [[engineering ethics]].]]\nEngineers have obligations to the public, their clients, employers and the profession. Many [[engineering societies]] have established codes of practice and codes of ethics to guide members and inform the public at large. Each engineering discipline and professional society maintains a code of ethics, which the members pledge to uphold. Depending on their specializations, engineers may also be governed by specific statute, whistleblowing, product liability laws, and often the principles of [[business ethics]].<ref>{{cite book | author = American Society of Civil Engineers | authorlink = American Society of Civil Engineers | year = 2006 | title = Code of Ethics | publisher = ASCE Press | location = Reston, Virginia, USA | url = http://www.asce.org/Leadership-and-Management/Ethics/Code-of-Ethics/ | accessdate = 2011-06-11 | origyear = 1914 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | author = Institution of Civil Engineers | authorlink= Institution of Civil Engineers | year = 2009 | title = Royal Charter, By-laws, Regulations and Rules | url = http://www.ice.org.uk/getattachment/c0b1371e-5179-49da-8e5f-62a6abe0b9fd/ICE-Royal-Charter,-By-laws,-Regulations-and-Rules.aspx | accessdate = 2011-06-11 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | author = National Society of Professional Engineers | authorlink = National Society of Professional Engineers | year = 2007 | title = Code of Ethics | publisher = NSPE | location = Alexandria, Virginia, USA | url = http://www.nspe.org/resources/pdfs/Ethics/CodeofEthics/Code-2007-July.pdf | accessdate = 2006-10-20 | origyear = 1964 }}</ref>\n\nSome graduates of engineering programs in North America may be recognized by the [[Iron Ring]] or [[Engineer's Ring]], a ring made of iron or stainless steel that is worn on the little finger of the dominant hand. This tradition began in 1925 in Canada with [[The Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer]], where the ring serves as a symbol and reminder of the engineer's obligations for the engineering profession. In 1972, the practice was adopted by several colleges in the United States including members of the [[Order of the Engineer]].\n\n==Education==\n{{Main|Engineering education}}\n\nMost engineering programs involve a concentration of study in an engineering specialty, along with courses in both mathematics and the physical and life sciences. Many programs also include courses in general engineering and applied accounting. A design course, sometimes accompanied by a computer or laboratory class or both, is part of the curriculum of most programs. Often, general courses not directly related to engineering, such as those in the social sciences or humanities, also are required.\n\n[[Educational accreditation|Accreditation]] is the process by which engineering program are evaluated by an external body to determine if applicable standards are met. The [[Washington Accord]] serves as an international accreditation agreement for academic engineering degrees, recognizing the substantial equivalency in the standards set by many major national engineering bodies. In the United States, post-secondary degree programs in engineering are accredited by the [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology]].\n\n==Regulation==\n{{Main|Regulation and licensure in engineering}}\n\nIn many countries, engineering tasks such as the design of bridges, electric power plants, industrial equipment, machine design and chemical plants, must be approved by a licensed professional engineer. Most commonly titled [[Professional Engineer]] is a license to practice and is indicated with the use of [[post-nominal letters]]; PE or P.Eng.  These are common in North America, as is European Engineer ([[European Engineer|Eur Ing]]) in Europe. The practice of engineering in the UK is not a regulated profession but the control of the titles of Chartered Engineer (CEng) and Incorporated Engineer (IEng) is regulated. These titles are protected by law and are subject to strict requirements defined by the Engineering Council UK.  The title CEng is in use in much of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]].\n\nMany semi-skilled trades and [[engineering technician]]s in the UK have, in the past, called themselves engineers. This is now seen as a misuse of the title, giving a false image of the profession. A growing movement in the UK is to legally protect the title 'Engineer' so that only professional engineers can use it; a DirectGov [[petition]]<ref>[http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/6271]</ref> has been started to further this cause.  Despite petitions in the UK the term engineer is still used by some unskilled or semi-skilled workers.\n\nIn the United States, licensure is generally attainable through combination of [[education]], pre-examination ([[Fundamentals of Engineering exam]]), examination (Professional Engineering Exam),<ref>[http://www.ncees.org/] NCEES is a national nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing professional licensure for engineers and surveyors.</ref> and engineering experience (typically in the area of 5+ years). Each state tests and licenses [[Professional Engineer]]s. Currently most states do not license by specific engineering discipline, but rather provide generalized licensure, and trust engineers to use professional judgement regarding their individual competencies; this is the favoured approach of the professional societies. Despite this, however, at least one of the examinations required by most states is actually focused on a particular discipline; candidates for licensure typically choose the category of examination which comes closest to their respective expertise.\n\nIn Canada, the profession in each province is governed by its own engineering association. For instance, in the Province of British Columbia an engineering graduate with four or more years of post graduate experience in an engineering-related field and passing exams in ethics and law will need to be registered by the Association for Professional Engineers and Geoscientists ([[APEGBC]])<ref>[http://www.apeg.bc.ca/ APEGBC - Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of BC<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> in order to become a Professional Engineer and be granted the professional designation of P.Eng allowing one to practice engineering.\n\nIn [[Continental Europe]], [[Latin America]], [[Turkey]] and elsewhere the title is limited by law to people with an engineering degree and the use of the title by others is illegal. In [[Italy]], the title is limited to people who both hold an engineering degree and have passed a professional qualification examination (''Esame di Stato''). In [[Portugal]], professional engineer titles and accredited engineering degrees are regulated and certified by the ''[[Ordem dos Engenheiros]]''. In the [[Czech Republic]], the title \"engineer\" (Ing.) is given to people with a (masters) degree in chemistry, technology or economics for historical and traditional reasons. In [[Greece]], the academic title of \"Diploma Engineer\" is awarded after completion of the five-year engineering study course and the title of \"Certified Engineer\" is awarded after completion of the four-year course of engineering studies at a Technological Educational Institute (TEI).\n\n==Perception==\n\n===Differences among countries===\nThe perception and definition of engineering varies across countries and continents. British school children in the 1950s were brought up with stirring tales of 'the Victorian Engineers', chief amongst whom were the [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel|Brunels]], the [[George Stephenson|Stephensons]], [[Thomas Telford|Telford]] and their contemporaries. In the UK, \"engineering\" was more recently perceived as an industry sector consisting of employers and employees loosely termed \"engineers\" who included the semi-skilled trades. However, the 21st-century view, especially amongst the more educated members of society, is to reserve the term Engineer to describe a university-educated practitioner of ingenuity represented by the Chartered (or Incorporated) Engineer.  But still most UK public see Engineers as semi skilled tradespeople with a high school education.\n\nIn the US and Canada, engineering is a regulated profession whose practice and practitioners are licensed and governed by law. A 2002 study by the Ontario Society of Professional Engineers revealed that engineers are the third most respected professionals behind doctors and pharmacists.<ref>Ontario Society of Professional Engineers, 2002, [http://www.ospe.on.ca/pdf/Newsletter-Feb-2002.pdf Engineering: One of Ontario's most respected professions]</ref>\n\nIn the [[Indian subcontinent]], [[Russia]] and [[China]], engineering is one of the most sought after undergraduate courses, inviting thousands of applicants to show their ability in highly competitive entrance examinations.\n\nIn [[Egypt]], the [[Education in Egypt|educational system]] makes engineering the second-most-respected profession in the country (after medicine); engineering colleges at [[Egyptian universities]] require extremely high marks on the General Certificate of Secondary Education ({{lang-ar|\u0627\u0644\u062b\u0627\u0646\u0648\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0645\u0629}} ''al-Th\u0101nawiyyah al-`\u0100mmah'')&mdash;on the order of 97 or 98%&mdash;and are thus considered (along with the colleges of medicine, natural science, and pharmacy) to be among the \"pinnacle colleges\" ({{lang|ar|\u0643\u0644\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0645\u0629}} ''kull\u012by\u0101t al-qimmah'').\n\n=== French \"Ing\u00e9nieur\" title===\n\nIn France, engineer is the title of the alumni of elite scientific \"Grandes Ecoles\" (Institutes of Technology), and the french \"engineer\" can thus be as well a scientist, a company top manager or a high civil servant. The title is only meaning the appartenance to french executive elite and has no relation to technological skills.\n\n===Corporate culture===\nIn companies and other organizations, there is sometimes a tendency to undervalue people with advanced technological and scientific skills compared to celebrities, fashion practitioners, entertainers and [[Management|managers]]. In his book ''[[The Mythical Man-Month]]'',<ref>The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering, p119 (see also p242), Frederick P. Brooks, Jr., University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 2nd ed. 1995, pub. Addison-Wesley</ref> Fred Brooks Jr says that managers think of senior people as \"too valuable\" for technical tasks, and that management jobs carry higher prestige. He tells how some laboratories, such as Bell Labs, abolish all job titles to overcome this problem: a professional employee is a \"member of the technical staff.\" IBM maintain a dual ladder of advancement; the corresponding managerial and engineering / scientific rungs are equivalent. Brooks recommends that structures need to be changed; the boss must give a great deal of attention to keeping his managers and his technical people as interchangeable as their talents allow.\n\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Engineering}}\n<!-- Please do not add links to non-existent articles -->\n*[[Engineering]]\n*[[Engineer's degree]]\n*[[Engineers Without Borders]]\n*[[Greatest Engineering Achievements]]\n*[[History of engineering]]\n*[[List of engineering branches]]\n*[[List of engineers]]\n*[[List of fictional scientists and engineers]]\n*[[Politician]]\n*[[Washington Accord]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|engineer}}\n{{Commons category|Engineers}}\n* [http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.destud.2004.09.004 Engineers\u2019 competencies]\n* [http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asi.21290 Engineers\u2019 information behaviours]\n* [http://cescientist.com/how-engineering-solutions-have-influenced-our-lives Engineers\u2019 How Engineers influence our life]\n* [http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.destud.2012.03.002 How engineers spend their time]\n* A {{YouTube|gPeTAKyiZC8|Presentation}} that explains in simple terms what engineers do, and what engineers don't do (contrasted to scientists and artists)\n\n{{Engineering fields}}\n{{Technology}}\n\n[[Category:Engineering occupations]]\n[[Category:Engineers|*]]\n[[Category:Science occupations]]", "Mathematician": "A '''mathematician''' is a person with an extensive [[knowledge]] of [[mathematics]] who uses this knowledge in their work, typically to solve [[mathematical problem]]s. Mathematics is concerned with [[number]]s, [[data]], [[collection]], [[quantity]], [[structure]], [[space]], [[Mathematical model|models]] and [[Calculus|change]].\n\nMathematicians involved with solving problems outside of pure mathematics are called [[applied mathematician]]s. Applied mathematicians are mathematical scientists who, with their specialized knowledge and [[professional]] methodology, approach many of the imposing problems presented in related scientific fields. With professional focus on a wide variety of problems, theoretical systems, and localized constructs, applied mathematicians work regularly in the study and formulation of [[mathematical models]]. Mathematicians and applied mathematicians are considered to be two of the STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) careers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Thinking About a STEM Career: Read This!|url=http://www.guidetoonlineschools.com/thelearningcurve/stem-careers-read-this|publisher=The Learning Curve|accessdate=10 May 2013}}</ref> \n\nThe discipline of [[applied mathematics]] concerns itself with mathematical methods that are typically used in science, engineering, business, and industry; thus, \"applied mathematics\" is a [[mathematical science]] with specialized knowledge. The term \"applied mathematics\" also describes the [[professional]] specialty in which mathematicians work on problems, often concrete but sometimes abstract. As professionals focused on problem solving, ''applied mathematicians'' look into the ''formulation, study, and use of mathematical models'' in [[science]], [[engineering]], [[business]], and other areas of mathematical practice.\n\n==Education==\nMathematicians usually cover a breadth of topics within mathematics in their [[undergraduate education]], and then proceed to specialize in topics of their own choice at the [[graduate-level]]. In some universities, a [[qualifying exam]] serves to test both the breadth and depth of a student's understanding of mathematics; the students who pass are permitted to work on a [[doctoral dissertation]].\n\n==Motivation==\n{{unreferencedsection|date=March 2013}}\nMathematicians do research in fields such as [[logic]], [[set theory]], [[category theory]], [[abstract algebra]], [[number theory]], [[analysis]], [[geometry]], [[topology]], [[dynamical systems]], [[combinatorics]], [[game theory]], [[information theory]], [[numerical analysis]], [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]], [[computation]], [[probability]] and [[statistics]]. These fields comprise both [[pure mathematics]] and [[applied mathematics]] and establish links between the two. Some of the fields they work in is, such as the theory of dynamical systems, or game theory, are classified as applied mathematics due to the relationships they possess with physics, economics and the other sciences. Whether probability theory and statistics are of theoretical nature, applied nature, or both, is quite controversial among mathematicians. Other branches of mathematics, however, such as logic, number theory, category theory or set theory are accepted as part of pure mathematics, though they find application in other sciences (predominantly [[computer science]] and [[physics]]). Likewise, analysis, geometry and topology, although considered pure mathematics, find applications in theoretical physics\u2014[[string theory]], for instance.\n\nThough it is true that mathematics finds diverse applications in many areas of research, a mathematician does not determine the value of an idea by the diversity of its applications. Mathematics is interesting in its own right, and a substantial minority of mathematicians investigate the diversity of structures studied in ''mathematics itself''. However, among academic mathematics, the majority of mathematical papers published in the United States are written by academics outside of mathematics departments. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nFurthermore, a mathematician is not someone who merely manipulates formulas, numbers or equations\u2014the diversity of mathematics allows for research concerning how concepts in one area of mathematics can be used in other areas too. For instance, if one graphs a set of solutions of an equation in some higher-dimensional space, he may ask about the geometric properties of the graph. Thus one can understand equations by a pure understanding of abstract [[topology]] or [[geometry]]\u2014this idea is of importance in [[algebraic geometry]]. Similarly, a mathematician does not restrict his study of numbers to the [[integer]]s; rather he considers more abstract structures such as [[Ring (mathematics)|rings]], and in particular [[number ring]]s in the context of [[algebraic number theory]]. This exemplifies the abstract nature of mathematics and how it is not restricted to questions one may ask in daily life.\n\nIn a different direction, mathematicians ask questions about space and transformations that are not restricted to geometric figures such as squares and circles. For instance, an active area of research in [[differential topology]] concerns itself with the ways one can \"smooth\" higher-dimensional figures. In fact, whether one can smooth certain higher-dimensional spheres was, until recently, an open problem \u2014 known as the smooth [[Poincar\u00e9 conjecture]]. Another aspect of mathematics, [[set-theoretic topology]] and [[point-set topology]], concerns objects of a different nature from objects in our universe, or in a higher-dimensional analogue of our universe. These objects behave in a rather strange manner under deformations, and the properties they possess are completely different from those of objects in our universe. For instance, the \"distance\" between two points on such an object, may depend on the order in which you consider the pair of points. This is quite different from ordinary life, in which it is accepted that the straight line distance from person A to person B is the same as that between person B and person A.\n\nAnother aspect of mathematics, often referred to as \"foundational mathematics\", consists of the fields of [[logic]] and [[set theory]]. These explore various ideas regarding the ways one can prove certain claims. This theory is far more complex than it seems, in that the truth of a claim depends on the context in which the claim is made, unlike basic ideas in daily life where truth is absolute. In fact, although some claims may be true, it is impossible to prove or disprove them in rather natural contexts.\n\nCategory theory, another field within \"foundational mathematics\", is rooted on the abstract axiomatization of the definition of a \"class of mathematical structures\", referred to as a \"category\". A category intuitively consists of a collection of objects, and defined relationships between them. While these objects may be anything (such as \"tables\" or \"chairs\"), mathematicians are usually interested in particular, more abstract, classes of such objects. In any case, it is the ''relationships between these objects'', and ''not the actual objects'' that are predominantly studied.\n\n== Occupations ==\nAccording to the [[Dictionary of Occupational Titles]] occupations in mathematics include the following.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://occupationalinfo.org/defset1_3829.html |title=020 OCCUPATIONS IN MATHEMATICS |work=Dictionary Of Occupational Titles |accessdate=2013-01-20}}</ref>\n\n* Mathematician\n* Operations-Research Analyst\n* Mathematical Statistician\n* Mathematical Technician\n* [[Actuary]]\n* Applied Statistician\n* Weight Analyst\n\n==Notable mathematicians==\n\nSome notable mathematicians include [[Johann Bernoulli]], [[Jacob Bernoulli]], [[Aryabhata]], [[Bh\u0101skara II]], [[Nilakantha Somayaji]], [[Andrey Kolmogorov]], [[Alexander Grothendieck]],  [[John von Neumann]], [[Alan Turing]], [[Kurt G\u00f6del]], [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]], [[Georg Cantor]], [[William Rowan Hamilton]], [[Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi|Carl Jacobi]], [[Nikolai Lobachevsky]], [[Joseph Fourier]], [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], [[Alonzo Church]], and [[Nikolay Bogolyubov]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"170\" heights=\"220\" caption=\"\" align=\"center\">\nEuklid-von-Alexandria_1.jpg|[[Euclid]], fl. 300 BC\nDomenico-Fetti Archimedes 1620.jpg|[[Archimedes]], c. \u2009287 \u2013 \u2009212 BC\nBrahmagupta.jpg| [[Brahmagupta]], 598 - 670\nAbu Abdullah Muhammad bin Musa al-Khwarizmi edit.png| [[Mu\u1e25ammad ibn M\u016bs\u0101 al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b]], c. 780 - 850\nOmar Khayyam Profile.jpg| [[Omar Khayy\u00e1m]], 1048 - 1131\nFrans Hals - Portret van Ren\u00e9 Descartes.jpg| [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]], 1596 - 1650\nPierre de Fermat.jpg| [[Pierre de Fermat]], 1601 - 1665\nGodfreyKneller-IsaacNewton-1689.jpg|[[Isaac Newton]], 1642 \u2013 1727\nGottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz.jpg| [[Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz]], 1646 - 1716\nLeonhard Euler.jpg|[[Leonhard Euler]], 1707 \u2013 1783\nJoseph-Louis_Lagrange.jpeg|[[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]], 1736 \u2013 1813\nCarl Friedrich Gauss.jpg|[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], 1777 \u2013 1855\nNiels Henrik Abel.jpg| [[Niels Henrik Abel]], 1802 - 1829\nEvariste galois.jpg| [[\u00c9variste Galois]], 1811 - 1832\nGeorg_Friedrich_Bernhard_Riemann.jpeg|[[Bernhard Riemann]], 1826 \u2013 1866\nFelix_Klein.jpeg|[[Felix Klein]], 1849 - 1925\nJH Poincare.jpg|[[Henri Poincar\u00e9]], 1854 \u2013 1912\nHilbert.jpg|[[David Hilbert]], 1862 \u2013 1943\nNoether.jpg|[[Emmy Noether]], 1882 \u2013 1935\nHermann_Weyl_ETH-Bib_Portr_00890.jpg| [[Hermann Weyl]], 1885 - 1955\nSrinivasa_Ramanujan_-_OPC_-_1.jpg|[[Srinivasa Ramanujan]], 1887 - 1920\n</gallery>\n\n== Quotations about mathematicians ==\n{{Wikiquote}}\nThe following are quotations about mathematicians, or by mathematicians.\n\n: ''A mathematician is a device for turning coffee into theorems.''\n::\u2014Attributed to both [[Alfr\u00e9d R\u00e9nyi]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Renyi.html |title=Biography of Alfr\u00e9d R\u00e9nyi |publisher=History.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> and [[Paul Erd\u0151s]]\n\n: ''Die Mathematiker sind eine Art Franzosen; redet man mit ihnen, so \u00fcbersetzen sie es in ihre Sprache, und dann ist es alsobald ganz etwas anderes.''

Robert Oppenheimer]] on the [[Manhattan Project]]), or for another role that requires scientific training and methods.\n\n==Australia==\n\nIn Australia, most government scientists are employed by the [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]]. A Chief Scientist is appointed to advise the government through the [[Office of the Chief Scientist (Australia)|Office of the Chief Scientist]].\n\n==Singapore==\nIn [[Singapore]], government scientists are classified according to the Departmental Titles (Alteration) (Amendment) Act 1996, which amended the Departmental Titles (Alteration) Ordinance of 1950.\n{{Expand section|date=January 2009}}\n\n==United Kingdom==\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], government scientists are part of the [[Her Majesty's Civil Service|Scientific Civil Service]]. However, that was not always the case. Before the Second World War, government scientists were recruited and employed by the Civil Service on an ad hoc basis, with grades, job titles, and organizations that varied between departments. In 1930, the Carpenter Committee was appointed to investigate the organization of civil service scientific and technical staff, and its report proposed a reorganization that covered the entire Service. This report was endorsed by the Tomlin Commission, however it was impossible to reach agreement with the relevant staff associations, who wanted other professional groups within the civil service to be similarly reorganized, and nothing ended up happening.<ref name=Gladden>{{cite book|title=Civil Services of the United Kingdom|author=E. N. Gladden|pages=35\u201337|year=1967|publisher=Frank Cass and Company Ltd|location=London}}</ref>\n\nWorld War Two changed this by causing a far greater number of scientific and technical staff to be employed by the government. The Barlow Committee on Scientific Staff in Government Departments reviewed the positions of government scientists during wartime, issuing a report on 1943-04-23. This report spurred the creation of a government [[white paper]], entitled ''The Scientific Civil Service'', which resulted in a reorganization of government scientisgts across the entire Service. This reorganization classified governmenvnt scientists across the entire Service into three major classes similar to those civil servants for the Treasury had already been classified in:<ref name=Gladden />\n;Scientific Officer class:Grades of scientific officer began with Scientific Officer, and progressed through Senior, Principal, Senior Principal, Deputy Chief, and Chief Scientific Officers.<ref name=Gladden />\n;Experimental Officer class:Grades of experimental officer began with Assistant Experimental Officer, and progressed through Experimental Officer to Senior and then Chief Experimental Officers. Experimental officers were either university graduates or people who had qualifications such as the [[Higher National Certificate]], and were support staff for Scientific Officers.<ref name=Gladden />\n;Scientific Assistant class:This class of civil servant undertook the routine work, and was largely equivalent to the Treasury's Clerical Class.<ref name=Gladden />\n\n==United States==\nIn the [[United States]], the employment of scientists by state and federal governments was, like in the U.K., affected by the Second World War. President Roosevelt first created the [[National Defense Research Committee]] under [[Vannevar Bush]]. This was then expanded to the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]], also led by Bush. The OSRD employed scientists on a contract basis, with the OSRD as client and individual scientists as contractors. Scientists were contracted to research (through study and experiement) a specified subject, without constraints as to method, and to issue reports to the OSRD.<ref name=UneasyAlliance>{{cite book|title=An Uneasy Alliance|author=J. Chandra and Stephen M. Robinson|pages=6\u20137|publisher=SIAM|year=2005|isbn=978-0-89871-535-4}}</ref>\n\nAfter the war, scientific research was continued by agencies such as the [[Office of Naval Research]] established in 1947, which again employed scientists as contractors. Scientific research was published in the normal way. The [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]], established in 1946, and the [[National Institutes of Health]], established in 1930, also paid scientists for scientific research, and were major sources of government research funding.<ref name=UneasyAlliance />\n\nThe [[National Science Foundation]] was eventually established in 1950. Defence research was explicitly excluded from its charter, even though Dr Bush had originally envisioned the NSF as including that as well. The armed forces established their own research departments, such as the [[Office of Ordnance Research]] for the [[United States Department of the Army|Department of the Army]], established on the campus of [[Duke University]] in June 1951.<ref name=UneasyAlliance />\n\nU.S. local, state, and federal governments also employ scientists directly. The federal government employs them in departments such as the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]], [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]], and the [[United States Public Health Service|Public Health Service]]. States and cities employ scientists in similar roles, including at fish and game commissions, parks, [[aquarium]]s, [[arboretum]]s, and [[museum]]s; and at agencies such as environmental inspection agencies, crime laboratories, and public health monitoring agencies.<ref>{{cite book|title=Opportunities in Biological Science Careers|author=Kathleen Belikoff and Charles A.

As recently as 1998, the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] called for the appointment of more science-savvy diplomats to the State Department to improve the quality of the scientific advice available to foreign policymakers.

Scientists perform research toward a more comprehensive understanding of [[nature]], including physical, mathematical and social realms.\n\n[[Philosophy]] can be seen as a distinct activity and which many consider not to be a science. It is aimed towards a more comprehensive understanding of intangible aspects of reality and experience that cannot be physically measured.\n\nScientists are also distinct from [[engineer]]s, those who design, build and maintain devices for particular situations. When science is done with a goal toward practical utility, it is called [[applied science]]. An applied scientist may not be designing something in particular, but rather is conducting research with the aim of developing new technologies and practical methods. When science is done with an inclusion of intangible aspects of reality it is called ''[[natural philosophy]]''.\n\n==Description==\n{{Infobox occupation\n| name           = \n| image          = [[File:InvestigadoresUR.JPG|300px]]\n| caption        = Scientists in a laboratory of the [[University of La Rioja]]\n| official_names = Scientist\n<!------------Details------------------->\n| type               = [[profession]]\n| activity_sector    = use of [[scientific method]]\n| competencies       = Science ([[Biology]], [[Chemistry]] and [[Physics]])\n| formation          = \n| employment_field   = \n| related_occupation = \n}}\n[[Science]] and [[technology]] have continually modified [[human]] existence through the engineering process. As a profession the scientist of today is widely recognized. Scientists include [[theory|theoreticians]] who mainly develop new models to explain existing data and predict new results, and [[experiment]]alists who mainly test models by making measurements \u2014 though in practice the division between these activities is not clear-cut, and many scientists perform both tasks.\n\n[[Mathematics]] is often grouped with the sciences. Some of the greatest [[physics|physicists]] have also been creative mathematicians. There is a continuum from the most theoretical to the most [[empiricism|empirical]] scientists with no distinct boundaries. In terms of [[personality psychology|personality]], interests, training and [[profession]]al activity, there is little difference between [[applied mathematics|applied mathematicians]] and [[theoretical physics|theoretical physicists]].\n\nScientists can be motivated in several ways. Many have a desire to understand why the [[world]] is as we see it and how it came to be. They exhibit a strong curiosity about [[reality]]. Other motivations are recognition by their peers and prestige, or the desire to apply scientific knowledge for the benefit of people's health, the nations, the world, nature or industries (academic scientist and [[industrial scientist]]).\n\n==Historical development and etymology of the term==\n{{See also|Timeline of the history of scientific method|Scientific revolution}}\nSocial roles that partly correspond with the modern scientist can be identified going back at least until 17th century natural philosophy, but the term ''scientist'' is much more recent.

Ross 1962, p.72.</ref> Whewell's suggestion of the term was partly satirical, a response to changing conceptions of science itself in which natural knowledge was increasingly seen as distinct from other forms of knowledge.  Whewell wrote of \"an increasing proclivity of separation and dismemberment\" in the sciences; while highly specific terms proliferated&mdash;chemist, mathematician, naturalist&mdash;the broad term \"philosopher\" was no longer satisfactory to group together those who pursued science, without the caveats of \"natural\" or \"experimental\" philosopher.  Members of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] had been complaining about the lack of a good term at recent meetings, Whewell reported in his review; alluding to himself, he noted that \"some ingenious gentleman proposed that, by analogy with ''artist'', they might form [the word] ''scientist'', and added that there could be no scruple in making free with this term since we already have such words as ''[[economist]]'', and ''[[atheist]]''&mdash;but this was not generally palatable\".<ref name=Holmes>{{cite book |last1= Holmes|first1= R|title= The age of wonder: How the romantic generation discovered the beauty and terror of science|edition= |year= 2008|publisher= Harper Press|location= London|isbn= 978-0-00-714953-7|page= 449}}</ref> Scientists are the people who ask a question about a phenomenon and proceed to systematically go about answering the question themselves.

Scientists of different eras (and before them, natural philosophers, mathematicians, natural historians, natural theologians, engineers, and other who contributed to the development of science) have had widely different places in society, and the [[social norms]], [[ethical values]], and [[epistemic virtues]] associated with scientists&mdash;and expected of them&mdash;have changed over time as well.  Accordingly, many different historical figures can be identified as early scientists, depending on which elements of modern science are taken to be essential.  Some historians point to the 17th century as the period when science in a recognizably modern form developed (what is popularly called the [[Scientific Revolution]]), and hence is when the first people who can be considered scientists are to be found.  If the category of \"scientist\" is limited to those who do scientific research as a profession, then the social role of scientist essentially emerged in the 19th century as part of the professionalization of science.<ref>On the historical development of the character of scientists and the predecessors, see: Steven Shapin (2008).  ''The Scientific Life: A Moral History of a Late Modern Vocation''.  Chicago: Chicago University Press.  ISBN 0-226-75024-8</ref>\n\n===Ancient and medieval science===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2013}}\n[[History of science in Classical Antiquity|Knowledge about nature in Classical Antiquity]] was pursued by many kinds of scholars. [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] contributions to science&mdash;including works of geometry and mathematical astronomy, early accounts of biological processes and catalogs of plants and animals, and theories of knowledge and learning&mdash;were produced by [[philosophers]] and [[physicians]], as well as practitioners of various trades.  These roles, and their associations with scientific knowledge, spread with the [[Roman Empire]] and, with the [[History of Christianity#Church of the Roman Empire (313\u2013476)|spread of Christianity]], became closely linked to religious institutions in most of [[Europe]].  [[Astrology and astronomy]] became an important area of knowledge, and the role of astronomer/astrologer developed with the support of political and religious [[patronage]].  By the time of the [[medieval university]] system, knowledge was divided into the ''[[Trivium (education)|trivium]]''&mdash;philosophy, including [[natural philosophy]]&mdash;and the ''[[quadrivium]]''&mdash;mathematics, including astronomy.  Hence, the medieval analogs of scientists were often either philosophers or mathematicians. Knowledge of plants and animals was broadly the province of physicians.\n\n[[Science in medieval Islam]] generated some new modes of developing natural knowledge, although still within the bounds of existing social roles such as philosopher and mathematician. Many proto-scientists from the [[Islamic Golden Age]] and medieval and [[Renaissance]] Europe are considered polymaths, in part because of the lack of anything corresponding to modern [[scientific discipline]]s.  Many of these early polymaths were also religious [[priest]]s and [[Theology|theologians]]: for example, Alhazen and [[Ab\u016b Rayh\u0101n al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b|al-Biruni]] were [[Kalam|mutakallimiin]]; the physician [[Avicenna]] was a [[Hafiz (Quran)|hafiz]]; the physician [[Ibn al-Nafis]] was a hafiz, [[muhaddith]] and [[ulema]]; the botanist [[Otto Brunfels]] was a theologian and historian of Protestantism; the astronomer and physician [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] was a priest.\n\n===Historical scientists===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}\n[[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Descartes]] was not only a pioneer of [[analytic geometry]] but formulated a [[theory]] of [[mechanics]] and advanced ideas about the origins of [[muscle contraction|animal movement]] and [[perception]]. [[Visual perception|Vision]] interested the [[physicist]]s [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Young]] and [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz]], who also studied [[optics]], [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]] and [[music]]. [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] extended Descartes' mathematics by inventing [[calculus]] (contemporaneously with [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]). He provided a comprehensive formulation of [[classical mechanics]] and investigated [[light]] and optics. [[Joseph Fourier|Fourier]] founded a new branch of mathematics \u2014 [[Fourier series|infinite, periodic series]] \u2014 studied [[heat]] [[flux#Flux definition and theorems|flow]] and [[infrared|infrared radiation]], and discovered the [[greenhouse effect]]. [[John von Neumann|Von Neumann]], [[Alan Turing|Turing]], [[Aleksandr Khinchin|Khinchin]], [[Andrey Markov|Markov]] and [[Norbert Wiener|Wiener]], all mathematicians, made major contributions to science and [[probability|probability theory]], including the ideas behind [[computer]]s, and some of the foundations of [[statistical mechanics]] and [[quantum mechanics]]. Many mathematically inclined scientists, including [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], were also [[musician]]s.\n\nIn the late 19th century, [[Louis Pasteur]], an [[organic chemistry|organic chemist]], discovered that [[microorganism]]s can cause [[disease]]. A few years earlier, [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.]], the [[United States|American]] [[physician]], poet and [[essayist]], noted that [[sepsis]] in women following [[childbirth]] was spread by the hands of doctors and [[nurse]]s, four years before [[Ignaz Semmelweis|Semmelweis]] in [[Europe]]. There are many compelling stories in [[medicine]] and [[biology]], such as the development of ideas about the circulation of [[blood]] from [[Galen]] to [[William Harvey|Harvey]]. The flowering of [[genetics]] and [[molecular biology]] in the 20th century is replete with famous names. [[Santiago Ram\u00f3n y Cajal|Ram\u00f3n y Cajal]] won the [[Nobel Prize]] in 1906 for his remarkable observations in [[neuroscience|neuroanatomy]].\n\nSome see a [[dichotomy]] between experimental sciences and purely \"[[observation]]al\" sciences such as [[astronomy]], [[meteorology]], [[oceanography]] and [[seismology]]. But [[astronomer]]s have done basic research in [[optics]], developed [[charge-coupled device]]s, and in recent decades have sent [[space probes]] to study other [[planet]]s in addition to using the [[Hubble Space Telescope|Hubble Telescope]] to probe the [[Cosmogony|origins]] of the [[Universe]] some 14 billion years ago. [[Rotational spectroscopy|Microwave spectroscopy]] has now identified dozens of [[organic compound|organic molecules]] in [[interstellar medium|interstellar space]], requiring [[laboratory]] experimentation and [[computer simulation]] to confirm the observational [[data]] and starting a new branch of chemistry. [[Computer simulation|Computer modeling]] and [[number|numerical]] methods are techniques required of students in every field of quantitative science.\n\n===Women in science===\n{{Main|Women in science}}\nThe percent of women entering into science are usually intertwined with engineering stats but the combination of the percentages shows the low numbers that are involved. The number of science and engineering doctorates awarded to women rose from a mere 7 percent in 1970 to 34 percent in 1985 and in engineering alone the numbers of bachelor's degrees awarded to women rose from only 385 in 1975 to more than 11000 in 1985.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nThe inequality prevails into the professional setting in ways such as starting position inequality and income inequality. According to Eisenhart and Finkel women experiences, even when they have equal qualifications, are that they start in lower-positions while men are granted tenure track positions. This later predicts an inequality of tenures positions as scientist in universities, \"as of 1989, 65 percent of men and only 40 percent of women held tenured positions.\" Income conflicts occur when median annual salaries for full-time employed civilian scientists, \"salary for men is $48,000, and that for women is $42,000.\"<ref>Eisenhart and Finkel, Ch 1 in The Gender and Science Reader  ed. Muriel Lederman and Ingrid Bartsch. New York, Routledge,  2001. (16-17)</ref>\n\n==Types of scientists==\nThose considering science as a [[career]] often look to the frontiers. These include [[physical cosmology|cosmology]] and [[biology]], especially [[molecular biology]] and the [[human genome]] project. Other areas of active research include the exploration of [[matter]] at the scale of [[elementary particle]]s as described by [[particle physics|high-energy physics]], and [[nanotechnology]], which hopes to develop [[electronics]] including microscopic [[computer]]s, and perhaps [[artificial intelligence]]. Although there have been remarkable discoveries with regard to [[Human brain|brain]] function and [[neurotransmitter]]s, the nature of the [[mind]] and [[human]] [[thought]] still remains unknown.\n\n===By field===\n* [[Agricultural]] scientists\n* [[Archaeologist]]s\n* [[Astronomer]]s\n**[[Astrophysicist]]s\n**[[astrobiology|Astrobiologists]]\n* [[Biologist]]s\n**[[Biotechnology|Biotechnologist]]s\n**[[Bioinformatics|Bioinformatician]]\n**[[Biophysics|Biophysicists]]\n**[[Botany|Botanists]]\n**[[Ecology|Ecologists]]\n**[[Entomology|Entomologists]]\n**[[Evolutionary biologist]]s\n**[[Geneticist]]s\n**[[Herpetology|Herpetologists]]\n**[[Immunology|Immunologists]]\n**[[Ichthyology|Ichthyologists]]\n**[[Lepidopterist]]s\n**[[Mammalogy|Mammalogists]] \n**[[Marine biologist]]s\n**[[Biomedical research|Medical scientists]]\n**[[Microbiologist]]s\n**[[Molecular biologist]]s\n**[[Mycology|Mycologists]]\n**[[Neuroscientist]]s\n**[[Nutritionist]]\n**[[Ornithology|Ornithologists]]\n**[[Paleontologists]]\n**[[Pathology|Pathologists]]\n**[[Pharmacology|Pharmacologists]]\n**[[Physiology|Physiologists]]\n**[[Virologist]]s\n**[[Zoology|Zoologists]]\n* [[Chemist]]s\n**[[Analytical chemist]]s\n**[[Biochemistry|Biochemists]]\n**[[Inorganic chemist]]s\n**[[Organic chemist]]s\n**[[Physical chemist]]s\n* [[Computer scientist]]s\n* [[Earth science|Earth scientists]]\n**[[Geologist]]s\n**[[Geophysicist]]s\n**[[Glaciology|Glaciologists]]\n**[[Hydrologist]]s\n**[[Limnology|Limnologists]]\n**[[Meteorologists]]\n**[[Mineralogy|Mineralogists]]\n**[[Oceanography|Oceanographers]]\n**[[Paleontology|Paleontologists]]\n**[[Seismology|Seismologists]]\n**[[Volcanology|Volcanologists]]\n* [[Library science|Library scientists]]\n* [[Mathematician]]s<ref name=\"Whewell\" />\n** [[Statisticians]] \n** [[Operations research analysts]]/[[Management scientist|Management Scientists]] \n** [[Actuaries]] <!-- (Some people constantly removes this category.

They build or set up equipment, conduct experiments, and collect data and calculate results. They might also help to make a model of new equipment.

University institutions having 4-year programs usually do not offer technical engineering training, but undergraduate courses in science and engineering, are useful for obtaining a job as an engineering technician. Many 3 and 4-year colleges and universities offer bachelor's degrees in engineering technology, but graduates of these programs often are hired to work as technologists or applied engineering assistants after further studies, not technicians. In some countries, there were [[vocational education]] schools that may have also conferred the title without awarding any degrees.\n\nBoth [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]] use the title of ''engenharia t\u00e9cnica''/''ingenier\u00eda t\u00e9cnica'', literally \"technical engineering\", for the professionals who were awarded a short-cycle 2- to 4-year undergraduate degree ([[associate degree]] or [[bachelor's degree]]) in a [[technology|technical]] [[engineering]] field by colleges or technical engineering institutes in the case of Portugal, and universities in Spain. Spanish \"technical engineers\" have full competency in their respective professional field of engineering, being the difference that the three year Engineers have competence only in their speciality (Mechanical, Electrical, Chemical, etc.)and the \"Engineering Superior School\" Engineers have wider competences.\n\nIn the [[United States]], the Technology Accreditation Commission of the [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology]] (ABET) grants 2-year associate program degrees to students that meet a set of specified standards. These programs include at least a college algebra and trigonometry course and, if needed, one or two basic science courses at any accredited school. The number of math and science prerequisite courses depends on the branch of engineering that the student chooses.\n\nEngineering technicians apply scientific and engineering skills usually gained in [[postsecondary]] programs below the bachelor's degree level or through short-cycle bachelor's degrees. However, some university institutions award undergraduate degrees in the field of engineering which may confer the title of Engineering technician to the student, who is, however, eligible to become a full chartered engineer after further studies at the masters degree level.  Engineering technicians are called professional engineers in the UK only.{{cite needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n==Certification==\nIn [[Canada]], the term '''certified engineering technician''' is protected by legislation and can only be used by technicians certified by provincial member organizations of the [[Canadian Council of Technicians and Technologists]], such as the [[Ontario Association of Certified Engineering Technicians and Technologists]] and the [http://www.aset.ab.ca  '''A'''ssociation of '''S'''cience and '''E'''ngineering '''T'''echnology Professionals of Alberta].\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the term '''Engineering Technician''' and [[post-nominals]] '''EngTech''' are protected in civil law, and can only be used by technicians registered with the [[Engineering Council UK]]. \n\nThe term [[engineer]] is not protected in the UK, however those holding EngTech accreditation can be employed as Engineers, providing they have the additional experience/qualifications.  In the UK the term \"Engineer\" is used by thousands of unskilled, semi-skilled and skilled trades.\n\nIn the eyes of professional engineers (but not the public) It is more acceptable to reserve the title 'Engineer' until you can fulfil the criteria required by the [[Engineering Council UK]] for Incorporated Engineer (IEng) or Chartered Engineer (CEng) status - A Bachelors / Masters Engineer Degree and additional professional practice experience (minimum 4 years) , as well as a nominated sponsor who can verify your claims is the most common method for IEng/CEng accreditation. \n\nThis procedure helps reduce the saturation of the term 'Engineer', a concern to many who have completed years of under-gradaute and post-graduate study and often work as 'Junior Support Engineers' for a number of years after graduation before being able to confidently state their profession.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal box|Technology and applied sciences}}\n\n*[[Practical engineer]]\n*[[Engineer]]\n*[[Engineering technologist]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|technician}}\n* [http://online.onetcenter.org/link/summary/17-3027.00 List of tasks and requirements for mechanical engineering technicians]\n* [http://www.imeche.org Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE)] UK\n* [http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=1909563 The Engineering Technician Forum on LinkedIn]\n{{Technology}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Engineering Technician}}\n[[Category:Engineering occupations]]\n[[Category:Post-nominal letters]]\n[[Category:Professional titles and certifications]]\n[[Category:Science occupations]]", "Engineering technologist": "{{Distinguish|Engineering technician}}\n\n[[File:Intel engineer Russ Brown tests Ultrabrook for mechanical shock.jpg|thumb|An engineering technologist at [[Intel]] tests an [[ultrabook]] for [[mechanical shock]], using a hydraulic platform to model a 3-foot drop onto concrete]]\nAn '''engineering technologist''' is a specialist dedicated to the development and implementation of existing [[technology]] within a field of [[engineering]].  Engineering technology education is more applied than the more theoretical science-based engineering degree education.  Technologists often work with [[engineers]] on a wide variety of projects by applying basic engineering principles and technical skills.  Engineering technologists also may assume senior management positions in industry or become entrepreneurs.\n\nThe work of technologists is usually focused on the portion of the technological spectrum closest to product improvement, manufacturing, construction, and engineering operational functions.  Engineering technology deals with the same topics as engineering, but the knowledge is more applied, as opposed to purely theoretical knowledge.  The mathematics and basic sciences, as well as the technical courses, in technology programs are taught with more applications and less theory than related engineering courses.  Engineering courses also typically require a higher level of knowledge of mathematics, as well as natural and engineering sciences, and prepare a student to continue studies and perform research at the graduate level.  Engineering technology courses generally have labs associated with the courses that require applied or hands-on applications of the topics being studied.\n\nInternationally, the [[Sydney Accord]] is an agreement signed in 2001 acknowledging the academic equivalence of accredited engineering technology programs in the signatory nations.  In some countries, only those individuals who have graduated from an [[school accreditation|accredited]] curriculum in engineering technology and have a significant amount of work experience in their field may become registered technologists.  A technologist's recognition may be in the form of a certification or a professional registration.\n\n== Nature of work ==\nTechnologists are employed in a large and wide array of industries, including manufacturing, construction, industrial, maintenance, and management. They may be hired as managers of technology, depending on the technologist's educational emphasis on management preparation.  Entry-level positions (such as [[product design]], [[Product testing|testing]], [[New product development|product development]], [[Software development methodology|systems development]], field engineering, technical operations, and [[quality control]] )are all common positions for engineering technology graduates.\n\nIn general, the work of engineering technologists focuses on the applied and practical application of engineering principles, whereas the work of [[engineer]]s emphasizes the theoretical aspects of mathematical, scientific and engineering principles. The [[National Society of Professional Engineers]] (NSPE) describes the difference between engineering and engineering technology:\n:\"The distinction between engineering and engineering technology emanates primarily from differences in their educational programs.  Engineering programs are geared toward development of conceptual skills, and consist of a sequence of engineering fundamentals and design courses, built on a foundation of complex mathematics and science courses.  Engineering technology programs are oriented toward application, and provide their students introductory mathematics and science courses, and only a qualitative introduction to engineering fundamentals.  Thus, engineering programs provide their graduates a breadth and depth of knowledge that allows them to function as designers.  Engineering technology programs prepare their graduates to apply others' designs.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nspe.org/GovernmentRelations/TakeAction/IssueBriefs/ib_eng_tech.html|title= Engineering Technology|work=NSPE Issue Briefs|publisher=[[NSPE]]|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110316114022/http://www.nspe.org/GovernmentRelations/TakeAction/IssueBriefs/ib_eng_tech.html|archivedate=2011-03-16}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology]] (ABET) describes the difference between engineering and engineering technology: \"Engineering and technology are separate, but intimately related professions.  Here are some of the ways they differ:\n:* Engineering undergraduate programs include more mathematics work and higher-level mathematics than technology programs.\n:* Engineering undergraduate programs often focus on theory, while technology programs usually focus on application.\n:* Once they enter the workforce, engineering graduates typically spend their time planning, while engineering technology graduates spend their time making plans work.\n:* At ABET, engineering and engineering technology programs are evaluated and accredited by two separate accreditation commissions using two separate sets of accreditation criteria.\n:* Graduates from engineering programs are called \"engineers,\" while graduates of technology programs are called \"technologists.\"\n:* Some U.S. state boards of professional engineering licensure will allow only graduates of engineering programs\u2014not engineering technology programs\u2014to become licensed engineers.\"<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.abet.org/faqs_hs.shtml#3 | publisher=[[ABET]]|title=Frequently Asked Questions - Parents and Students|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110716070328/http://www.abet.org/faqs_hs.shtml#3|archivedate=2011-07-16}}</ref>\n\nEngineers generally operate in [[conceptual design]] and product development, while technologists generally work in testing, construction, or field work.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://et.uncc.edu/engineering-vs-engineering-technology.html|title=Engineering vs. Engineering Technology|publisher=Department of Engineering Technology and Construction Management, The [[University of North Carolina]] at Charlotte}}</ref>\n\n==Education and accreditation==\nBeginning in the 1950s and 1960s, some post-secondary institutions in the U.S. and Canada began offering degrees in engineering technology, focusing on applied study rather than the more theoretical engineering science degrees.  The focus on applied study addressed a need within the scientific, manufacturing, and engineering communities, as well as other industries, for professionals with hands-on and applications-based engineering knowledge.  Depending on the institution, [[associate's degree|associate's]] and/or [[bachelor's degree|bachelor's]] degrees are offered, with some institutions also offering [[postgraduate education|advanced degrees]] in technology.\n\nIn general, an engineering technologist receives a broad range of [[applied science]] and [[applied mathematics]] training, as well as the fundamentals of engineering in the student's area of focus.  Engineering technology programs typically include instruction in various engineering support functions for research, production, and operations, and applications to specific engineering specialties.<ref>\n{{cite web|publisher=U.S. Department of Education Institute of Education Sciences|title= Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP), Engineering Technologies/Technicians |url=http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2002/cip2000/ciplist.asp?CIP2=15|accessdate=October 26, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Wright, Jr.|first=John|title=Venn Diagram Definitions|url= http://atmae.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=227&Itemid=48 |year=2009|accessdate=2010-10-13}}</ref> [[Information technology]] is primarily involved with the management, operation, and maintenance of computer systems and networks, along with an application of technology in diverse fields such as [[architecture]], engineering, [[graphic design]], [[telecommunications]], [[computer science]] and [[network security]].  A technologist is also expected to have had some coursework in [[ethics]].\n\nInternational technology organizations from eight nations have signed a mutual recognition agreement called the [[Sydney Accord]], which represents an understanding that the academic awards of technologists can be recognized in all signatory states.  The recognition of the Sydney Accord for technologists can be compared to the [[Washington Accord]] for [[engineer]]s and the [[Dublin Accord]] for [[engineering technician]]s.  The [[Engineering Technologist Mobility Forum]] is an international forum held by signatories of the Sydney Accord to explore mutual recognition for experienced engineering technologists and to remove artificial barriers to the free movement and practice of engineering technologists amongst their countries.\n\nGraduates acquiring an associate's degree or lower typically find careers as [[engineering technicians]].  According to the United States [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]]: \"Many four-year colleges offer bachelor\u2019s degrees in engineering technology, but graduates of these programs often are hired to work as technologists or applied engineers, not technicians.\"<ref>{{Cite web | title = Engineering Technicians\n  | work = Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2010-11 Edition\n  | publisher = Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor\n  | date = December 17, 2009\n  | url = http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos112.htm\n | accessdate = 2010-10-13 }}</ref> Technicians typically hold a two-year associate's degree, while technologists usually hold bachelor's degrees.\n\n=== Canada ===\nIn Canada, the new occupational category of \"technologist\" was established in the 1960s in conjunction with an emerging system of community colleges and [[Institute of technology|technical institutes]].  It was designed to effectively bridge the gap between the increasingly theoretical nature of engineering science degrees and the predominately practical approach of [[technician]] and trades programs.  Provincial associations may certify individuals as a [[Professional Technologist]] (P.Tech), [[Certified Engineering Technologist]] (C.E.T.), [[Professional_Technologist#Registered_Engineering_Technologist_-_Alberta_-_R.E.T.|Registered Engineering Technologist (R.E.T.)]], [[Applied Science Technologist]] (AScT) or Technologue Professionel [T.P.].  These provincial associations are constituent members of the [[Canadian Council of Technicians and Technologists]] (CCTT), which nationally accredits technology programs across Canada through its [[Canadian Technology Accreditation Board]] (CTAB).  Nationally accredited engineering technology programs range from two to three years in length, depending on province, with two-year programs leading to a C.Tech. certification and three-year programs usually leading to an AScT, CET or RET certification.\n\n===United States===\nIn the United States, the hierarchy of educational structure and acknowledgement start at the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]] or the [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]] (CHEA).  The U.S. Department of Education acknowledges regional and national [[accreditation]]s, and CHEA recognizes specialty accreditations.  Two technology accreditations are currently recognized by CHEA: The [[Association of Technology, Management, and Applied Engineering]] (ATMAE) and the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET).  Specifically, CHEA recognizes ABET internationally and in the U.S. for accrediting engineering technology programs at the associate and baccalaureate level.  CHEA also recognizes ATMAE for accrediting associate, baccalaureate, and master\u2019s degree programs in technology, applied technology, engineering technology, and technology-related disciplines delivered by national or regional accredited institutions in\nthe United States (2011).<ref>[http://www.chea.org/pdf/d_Summary%20for%20ATMAE.pdf ATMAE Scope of Recognition]</ref>\n\nABET has been accrediting engineering technology programs in the United States since 1946, with a total of over 600 programs at more than 230 institutions.  In response to heavy demand, ABET began accrediting engineering technology programs internationally in 2007.  Depending on the institution, associate's and/or bachelor's degrees are offered, with a few institutions also offering [[postgraduate education|advanced degrees]].  The type, length, and quality of education offered can vary greatly depending on the educational institution and the specialty pursued within engineering technology. ATMAE-accredited programs in engineering technology require a management core.\n\nThe Engineering Technology Accreditation Commission (ETAC) of [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology]] was admitted as a provisional member of International Technology Accords in 2007, and it signed the Sydney Accord in 2009.\n\nOther U.S. [[United States Secretary of Education|Secretary of Education]] and CHEA-recognized accrediting agencies in the U.S.\u2014(such as the [[Distance Education and Training Council|Distance Education and Training Council (DETC)]] Accrediting Council and the [[Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools]] (ACICS)\u2014accredit colleges and universities with programs leading to bachelor's and master's degrees in engineering and engineering technologies.  Graduates of the nationally accredited programs are accepted into government, civil services and military sectors, and all U.S. employers recognize nationally accredited degrees.\n\n==Certification==\n[[Professional certification]] is the registration of engineering technologists to assure their qualification within their countries or territories.  The Sydney Accord and the [[Engineering Technologist Mobility Forum]] (ETMF) are two international efforts to improve cross-border recognition for technologists.\n\nA certified engineering technologist is usually required to [[Apprenticeship|apprentice]] for a term before being able to apply for certification through a local [[Board of governors|governing body]].  In that time, the technologist must have completed tasks which directly apply to his or her area of study.\n\n===North America===\nIn Canada, the regulated title for technologists is [[Certified Engineering Technologist]].  Technology program accreditation is administered through the [[Canadian Technology Accreditation Board]] (CTAB), often in conjunction with provincial associations affiliated with the [[Canadian Council of Technicians and Technologists]].  Graduated technologists are certified by their provincial bodies.\n\nIn the United States, technologist certification requires a bachelor's degree in an engineering technology program accredited by the Engineering Technology Accreditation Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ETAC/ABET). One may also obtain a degree from an institution accredited through The [[Association of Technology, Management, and Applied Engineering]] (formerly known as the National Association of Industrial Technology).  Technologist registration in the United States is conducted by many independent societies and organizations.  A government-sponsored registration is opposed by the [[National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying|National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying (NCEES)]] and NSPE.  As a result, the profession is often not seen as an independent field separate from design engineering.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nThe [[National Institute for Certification in Engineering Technologies]] (NICET) awards certification at two levels depending on work experience: the [[Associate Engineering Technologist]] (AT) and the [[Certified Engineering Technologist]] (CT).  The [[Association of Technology, Management, and Applied Engineering]] (ATMAE) awards two levels of certification in technology management: Certified Technology Manager (CTM) and Certified Senior Technology Manager (CSTM).  ATMAE also awards two levels of certification in manufacturing specialist: Certified Manufacturing Specialist (CMS) and Certified Senior Manufacturing Specialist (CSMS).  While the CTM and CMS certification are obtained through examination, the CSTM and CSMS require industry experience and continuous improvement via the obtainment of professional development units (PDUs).\n\nAmerican Society of Certified Engineering Technicians (ASCET) is a membership organization that issues Certified Member certifications to engineering technicians and engineering technologists.  Professional engineers are issued Registered Member certification.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n\nThe United Kingdom has a decades-long tradition of producing engineering technologists via the apprenticeship system of learning.  U.K. engineering technologists have always been loosely designated as \"engineers\".  The modern term for an engineering technologist is \"incorporated engineer\" (IEng), although since 2000 the normal route to achieving IEng is with a Bachelors or Honours Degree in engineering.  Apprenticeships would normally lead to the [[EngTech]] professional qualification.  The title \"incorporated engineer\" is protected by civil law.  Prior to the title \"incorporated engineer,\" U.K. technologists were known as \"technician engineers\".\n\nIn the United Kingdom, an incorporated engineer is accepted as  a \"professional engineer,\" registered by the [[Engineering Council]], although the term \"professional engineer\" has no legal meaning in the U.K., and there are no restrictions on practice.  In fact, anyone in the U.K. can call themselves an \"engineer\" or \"professional engineer\" without any qualifications or proven competencies, and most U.K. skilled trades are sometimes referred to as \"professional\" or \"accredited\" engineers.\n\nIncorporated engineers are recognized internationally through the Sydney Accord academic agreement as engineering technologists.<ref>\n{{cite book | last = Hunt | first = S.E. |date=June 1996 | title = Mapping The World of Education: The Comparative Database System | volume = 2 | pages = 365\u2013372 | publisher = [[National Science Foundation]] | accessdate = 23 October 2005 | url = http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/mapping/ | chapter = (GB) United Kingdom | chapterurl = http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/mapping/pdf/degu.pdf | format = [[PDF]]}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite web | url = http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2005/20050018.htm | title = The European Communities (Recognition of Professional Qualifications) (First General System) Regulations 2005 | publisher = [[Office of Public Sector Information]]}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite web | url = http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2007/20072781.htm | title = The European Communities (Recognition of Professional Qualifications) Regulations 2007 | publisher = [[Office of Public Sector Information]]}}</ref>\nOne of the professional titles for engineers in the United Kingdom, recognized in the Washington Accord is the [[Chartered Engineer (UK)|chartered engineer]].

As a result, the chartered and incorporated engineer are placed under the same directive, 2005/36/EC.  The incorporated engineer can practice autonomously without the oversight of a chartered engineer.\n\nIncorporated engineers currently require an IEng accredited bachelors or honours degree in engineering (prior to 1997 the B.Sc. and B.Eng. degrees satisfied the academic requirements for \"chartered engineer\" registration), a [[Higher National Certificate]] or diploma, or a [[Foundation Degree]] in engineering, plus appropriate further learning to degree level or an NVQ4 or SVQ4 approved for the purpose by a licensed engineering institution.\n\nThe academic requirements must be accompanied by the appropriate experience in employment.  In addition to the experience and academic requirements, the engineering candidate must have three referees (themselves CEng or IEng) that vouch for the performance of the individual being considered for professional recognition.  There are a number of alternative ways to achieve IEng status for those that do not have the necessary qualifications for applicants, that can clearly show they have achieved the same level as those with qualifications, including:\n\n* writing a technical report, based upon their experience, and demonstrate their knowledge and  understanding of engineering principles;\n* taking Engineering Council examinations through the [[City and Guilds of London Institute]];\n* following a work-based learning programme; or \n* taking an academic programme specified by the institution to which they are applying.\n\n<!-- this is a useful link, but doesn't really go with any of the specific text here\nhttp://www.shu.ac.uk/engineering/types-incorporated.html -->\n\n===Germany - European Union ===\n\n====State-certified Engineer====\n\nThe state-certified engineer is a [[European Union]] qualification for professional engineering technologist (not to be confused with engineering technician).  It is granted to engineering technologists upon successful completion of a technical college, and it is also granted by an international organization with headquarters in Germany, the Bundesverband h\u00f6herer Berufe der Technik, Wirtschaft und Gestaltung e.V. (\"Association of Higher Professions for Teconomy and Design\") or BVT.\n\nA member of the BVT is entitled to use the initials BVT after his name and the title \"state-certified engineer BVT\".  To reach this qualification, candidates must complete a supervised apprenticeship program of three-and-a-half years, complete a minimum of a 2,400-hour engineering or technology program at a technical college; complete two years of relevant experience; and successfully pass the state examinations.\n\nAs of Jan 31, 2012, the state certified engineer is a \"level 6 on EQF,\" the equivalent of \"bachelor\" on the European Qualification Framework (EQF).  A bachelors (Hon) degree in engineering or engineering technology from an accredited university is also equated to level 6 on EQF, on the same level as a bachelors degree.  A candidate may continue to study to a masters degree with the SCE qualification.  The academic requirements for qualification are similar to incorporated engineer qualification/registration by E.C. U.K.  State certified engineers now assist master's and diploma engineers, and they also hold full engineering positions for [[systems engineer]]s, [[integration engineer]]s, [[test engineer]]s and [[QA engineer]]s.\n\n====State-certified technicians/engineers in the EU directives====\n\nAs of January 31, 2012, state certified engineers, state certified business managers, and state certified designers are at level 6-Bachelor on the DQF and EQF.  The qualifications more than a decade ago were entered into [[Directive (European Union)|EU Directives]] as recognized regulated professions in Germany and the EU.  Annexes C and D were added to Council Directive 92/51/EEC on a second general system for the recognition of professional education and training to supplement Directive 89/48/EEC.\n\nTop institutions involved included the federal government (the [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Education and Research]] and the [[Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology]]), EU Standing Conference and Economic Ministerial Meeting of Countries, the German Confederation of Hand-plant, the [[Confederation of German Employers' Associations]], German Chambers of Industry and Commerce, [[Confederation of German Trade Unions]], and Federal Institute for Vocational Application.  These government institutions agreed on a common position on the implementation of the EQF and a German qualifications framework (DQR).\n\nEuropean Union law and other documents considered to be public include:\n* http://eur-lex.europa.eu//en/index.htm\n* Annexes C and D to Council Directive 92/51/EEC on a second general system for the recognition of professional education and training to supplement Directive 89/48/EEC\n* EU Directive 2005L0036-EN 01.01.2007\n* ANNEX III list of regulated education and training referred to in the third sub paragraph of Article 13(2)\n* http://www.scribd.com/doc/53286830/Directive-2005-36-EC\n\nThe qualifications framework requires: \"regulated courses for the professions of state-certified ('staatlich gepruefte(r)') technician/engineer ('Techniker(in)'), business economist (business manager), ('Betriebswirt(in)'), designer ('Gestalter(in)') and family assistant ('Familiepfleger(in)'), of a total duration not less than 16 years, a prerequisite of which is successful completion of compulsory schooling or equivalent education and training (of a duration of not less than nine years) and successful completion of a course at a trade school ('Berufsschule') of a duration of not less than three years and comprising, upon completion of at least two years of work experience, full-time education and training of a duration of not less than two years or part-time education and training of equivalent duration.\"\n\n===International engineering technologist (IntET)===\nThe international engineering technologist (IntET) qualification was launched in late 2007 by the Engineering Technologists Mobility Forum (ETMF), which is part of the International Engineering Alliance (IEA).  The qualification is awarded by each member jurisdiction followed by a jurisdictional identifier, such as IntET (UK) for the U.K.\n\nIn addition to the benefits gained through IEng professional qualification (an eligibility requirement), IntET (UK) offers additional benefits, including letters after name (such as \"J. Smith IEng IntET (UK)\") and easier admission to National Registers of IntET register member jurisdictions.  The Engineering Council and its fellow ETMF members are pursuing the possibility of future mutual recognition of professional titles, which would further enhance the benefits of IntET qualification.\n\nThe IntET (UK) qualification is open to U.K.-registered incorporated engineers who have met the requirements: seven years post-graduate experience, two years responsibility of significant engineering work, and maintaining continuing professional development.  Incorporated engineers who do not hold an accredited degree recognised under the Sydney Accord, or equivalent academic qualification, are currently not eligible to apply for IntET (UK) qualification.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Association of Science and Engineering Technology Professionals of Alberta (ASET)]]\n\n*[[Island Technology Professionals]]\n\n==References and notes==\n<references />\n*{{Cite journal\n|last=Sastry\n|first=M.K.S.\n|coauthors=Clement K.
