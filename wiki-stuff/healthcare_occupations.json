In contrast, the term ''anesthetist'' is used for [[Nurse anesthetist|nurse anesthesia]] providers who have undergone specialized training in anesthesia.\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], most former [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries and in Europe the term ''anaesthetist'' refers only to physicians (university graduates in medicine) specialised in anaesthetics. In a few UK hospitals some duties are performed by non-physicians, Physicians' Assistants (Anaesthesia),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rcoa.ac.uk/node/261 |title=Physicians' Assistant (Anaesthesia) &#124; The Royal College of Anaesthetists |publisher=Rcoa.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-04-08}}</ref> but only under physician anaesthetist supervision. In several European countries (e.g. Germany, Austria) anaesthesia is exclusively provided by physicians (1:1 ratio anaesthetist:patient), while anaesthesia nurses (or anaesthesia technicians) assist the anaesthetist.<ref>[http://www.dgai.de/downloads/MuensteranerErklaerung_Parallelnarkose11-04.pdf ]{{dead link|date=April 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Role in healthcare delivery==\nAnesthesiologists (anaesthetists in the UK) are physicians who provide medical care to patients in a wide variety of (usually acute) situations. This includes a preoperative evaluation, consultation with the surgical team, creation of a plan for the anaesthesia tailored to each individual patient, airway management, intraoperative life support and provision of pain control, intraoperative diagnostic stabilisation, and proper post-operative management of patients.  For anesthesiologists/anaesthetists, preparation of patients for emergency surgery is mandatory and essential. Because anesthesiologists/anaesthetists are physicians, in contrast to other anesthesia providers, they are able to utilize their extensive knowledge of physiology, pharmacology and diseases to guide their decision making.\n\nIn the USA, there has been a shortage of anesthesiologists historically. In order to better serve the population, residency positions in anesthesiology for physicians have been steadily increasing the past several years. In addition, US physicians supervise ACTs, or Anesthesia Care Teams, which are composed of a supervising physician with several certified registered nurse anesthetists ([[Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist|CRNA]]s) or anesthesiologist assistants (AAs). In other areas of the USA, anesthesiologists work in what is deemed a \"solo\" or \"[[Doctor of Medicine|MD]]/[[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|DO]] only\" practice, during which they provide anesthesia in a \"one on one\" relationship with the patient.\n\nA consultant anaesthetist in the UK is a fully qualified doctor, who has spent at least 9 years (7 of which should be in anaesthesia) after graduation as a trainee, and is appointed as a consultant. Trainee anaesthetists in the UK are fully qualified doctors on their way to become consultants; they could be two years or even 10 years post graduation.\n\n== Anesthesiologists/Anaesthetists and patient-informed consent ==\nPatient-informed consent is a fundamental ethical and legal principle and is considered essential to patient autonomy. The [[American Society of Anesthesiologists]], the American Osteopathic College of Anesthesiologists, and other professional organizations, such as the [[American Association of Nurse Anesthetists]], support the principle that patients should be fully informed regarding the manner in which their anesthetic will be administered. In Germany, the law requires that prior to anaesthesia informed consent of the patient must be obtained by the anaesthetist.\n\nDue to medications given before, during, and after surgery, a patient may sometimes not remember interacting with the anesthesiologist/anaesthetist, nurse anesthetist, or anesthesiologist assistant involved in their anaesthesia care. The anaesthetic plan, as well as alternatives, risks, and benefits of the chosen anaesthetic techniques, should be discussed with the patient prior to surgery (This can be difficult or impossible in some situations, such as with unconscious patients, confused patients, or extremely urgent cases).\n\n==Training by country==\nPhysician training in anaesthesiology in developed countries is quite similar.\n\n===Argentina===\nIn Argentina, ''anaesthetists'' are physicians who have specialized in the medical field of anaesthesia. Residency is 5 years long.\n\n===Australia and New Zealand===\nIn Australia and New Zealand, ''anaesthetists'' are physicians (with the degree of Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery i.e. MB ChB or MB BS) who have specialized in the medical field of anaesthesia.\n\nIn Australia and New Zealand, anaesthetists are represented by the [[Australian Society of Anaesthetists]] and the New Zealand Society of Anesthetists. Training is overseen by the [[Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists]].\nThe ANZCA approved training sequence encompasses an initial two-year Pre-vocational Medical Education and Training (PMET) period and the five-year period of ANZCA Approved Training (two years Basic Training and three years Advanced Training).\n\nIn the course of Approved Training, Trainees are required to successfully complete:\n\n- Five years of supervised clinical training at Approved Training Sites<br />\n- Both the Primary and Final Examinations which consist of both written (multiple choice questions and short answer questions) and, if successful at the written component, oral examinations<br />\nIn the final examination, there are many stations of clinical scenarios (including interpretation of radiological exams, EKGs and other special investigations). There is also two stations of real patients with complex medical conditions - for clinical examination and a following discussion.\n- A program of 12 modules such as obstetric anaesthesia, pediatric anaesthesia, cardiothoracic and vascular anaesthesia, neurosurgical anaesthesia and pain management.<br />\n- Completion of an advanced project, such as a research publication or paper.<br />\n- An EMAC (Effective Management of Anaesthetic Crises) or EMST (Early Management of Severe Trauma) course.\n\nOn completion of all Training Program requirements the Trainee will be awarded the Diploma of Fellowship and be entitled to use the qualification of FANZCA \u2013 Fellow of the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists.\n\n===Canada===\n\nIn Canada anaesthesiologists are physicians (with the degree MD - Medicinae Doctorem or MDCM - Medicinae Doctorem et Chirurgiae Magistrum) who have specialized in the medical field of anaesthesiology.\n\nTraining is overseen by 16 universities approved by the [[Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada]]. Upon completion of a residency program, (typically five years) the candidate is required to pass a comprehensive objective examination consisting of a written component (two three-hour papers: one featuring 'multiple choice' questions, and the other featuring 'short-answer' questions) and an oral component (a two-hour session made up of stations on the clinical aspects of anaesthesiology). The examination of a patient is not required.\n\nUpon completion of all training requirements, the anaesthesiology graduate is then entitled to become a \"Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Canada\" and to use the post-nominal letters \"FRCPC\".\n\n===Germany===\nIn Germany, anaesthetists (German: ''Anaesthesist'' or ''Facharzt f\u00fcr Anaesthesiologie'') are the only anaesthesia providers as German law does not allow anyone but a physician to practice medicine - physician centered medicine (German: ''Arztvorbehalt''). After earning the right to practice medicine (German: ''Approbation''),<ref>http://www.bundesaerztekammer.de/downloads/Empfehlungen_Persoenliche_Leistungserbringung.pdf</ref> German physicians who want to become anaesthetists have to go through a 5-year training, ending with a board examination, held by the state chamber of physicians (German: ''Landes\u00e4rztekammer''). \nGerman Anaesthetists are trained in all aspects of anaesthesia, including ECG and pulmonary function testing, critical care and pain medicine as well as palliative care medicine. The training includes rotations serving in the operating theatre to perform anaesthesia on a variety of patients being treated by every kind of surgical sub-specialty (i.e. [[general surgery]], [[neurosurgery]] or invasive [[Urology|urological]] and [[Gynaecology|gynecological]] procedures), followed by a rotation through various [[Intensive care unit|intensive-care]] units.<ref>http://www.blaek.de/weiterbildung/wbo_2010/download/WBO/B/M10FAAnaesthesiologie.pdf</ref>\nMany German anaesthetists choose to complete a curriculum in emergency medicine, which once completed, enables them to be referred to as [[:de:Notarzt|Notarzt]], an emergency physician working pre-clinically with the [[Emergency Medical Service]]. In the pre-clinical setting the emergency physician is assisted by [[paramedic]]s.<ref>http://www.blaek.de/weiterbildung/wbo_2004/download/WBO/C/notfall.pdf</ref>\n\n===The Netherlands===\nAnaesthetists in The Netherlands must have completed medical school, which takes six years on average. After successfully completing medical school they start a five year residency training in anaesthesiology. In their fifth year they can choose to spend the year doing research, or to specialize in a certain area, including regular anaesthesia, critical care medicine, pain and palliative medicine, paediatric anaesthesiology, cardiothoracic anaesthesiology, neuro anaesthesiology, obstetric anaesthesiology.\n\n===Guatemala===\n{{Refimprove|date=July 2013}}\nTo specialize in anesthesiology in Guatemala, a student with a medical degree (he or she must have  surgery and general medicine skills by law) completes a residency of six years (five years in residency and one year of practice with an expert anesthesiologist). After residency, students take a board examination overseen by the College Of Medicine of Guatemala, the Universidade De San Carlos De Guatemala (Medicine Faculty Examination Board), and a chief physician who represents the health care ministry of the government Of Guatemala. The examination includes a written section, an oral section, and a special examination of skills and knowledge relating to anesthesia instruments, emergency treatment, pre-operative care, post-operative care, intensive care units, and pain medicine.\n\nAfter passing the examination, the College Of Medicine of Guatemala, Universidad De San Carlos De Guatemala and the health care ministry of the government of Guatemala grants the new anesthesiologist a special license to practice anesthesiology as well as a diploma issued by the Universidad De San Carlos De Guatemala granting the degree of physician with specialization in anesthesiology. Anesthesiologists in Guatemala are also subject to yearly examinations and mandatory participation in a yearly seminary on the latest developments in anesthesiology.\n\n=== Hong Kong ===\nTo be qualified as a specialist anaesthetist in Hong Kong, medical practitioners must undergo a minimum of six years of postgraduate training and pass three professional examinations. Upon completion of training, the Fellowship of Hong Kong College of Anaesthesiologists and subsequently the Fellowship of Hong Kong Academy of Medicine would be awarded. Practicing specialist anaesthetists are required to register in the Specialist Register of the Medical Council of Hong Kong and hence are under the regulation of the Medical Council.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sahk.hk/Presssedation.htm |title=Press release on sedation for minor surgery |publisher=Sahk.hk |date=2006-03-01 |accessdate=2012-10-28}}</ref>\n\n===Italy===\nIn Italy, the Anaesthesiologist-Intensive Care is a doctor who, after graduation from Medical School (6.5 years), has completed a residency of four years (five years starting in 2008).\nThey can work in Operating Rooms, ICUs, PACUs, Pain Units, Hyperbaric Units and Emergency Departments.\n\n===Scandinavia===\nIn Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, anaesthetist training is overseen by the respective national societies of anaesthesiology as well as the [[Scandinavian Society of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine (SSAI)]]. In Scandinavia, anaesthesiology is the medical specialty that is engaged in the fields anaesthesia, intensive care medicine, pain medicine, and pre- and in-hospital emergency medicine.\n\nAnaesthesiologist in the Scandinavian countries are doctors who have completed a six-year undergraduate training program (from Medical School), a twelve-month internship, and a five-year residency program. SSAI currently hosts five training programs for anaesthesiologists in Scandinavia. These are Intensive Care, Pediatric Anesthesia and Intensive Care, Advanced Pain Medicine, Critical Care Medicine, Advanced Obstetric Anesthesia.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nIn England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, training is overseen by the [[Royal College of Anaesthetists]].  ''Anaesthetists'' in the United Kingdom are doctors who have completed either a five-year or six-year undergraduate training program or a four-year program open only to open to post graduates.\n\nFollowing the completion of medical school, doctors enter the two-year Foundation Program which consists of at least six, four-month rotations in various medical specialties. It is mandatory for all doctors to complete a minimum of three months of general medical and general surgical training in this time.\n\nFollowing the Foundation Programme, doctors compete for specialist training in anaesthetics. The training program in the United Kingdom currently consists of two years of Core Training and five years of Higher Training. Trainees wishing to hold dual accreditation in Anaesthetics and Intensive Care Medicine may enter anaesthesia training via the Acute Care Common Stem (ACCS) program which lasts three years and consists of experience in anaesthesia, emergency medicine, acute medicine and intensive care. Trainees in anaesthesia are called Specialty Registrars (StR) or Specialist Registrars (SpR).\n\nBefore the end of Core Training, all anaesthetic trainees must have passed the primary examination of the diploma of Fellowship of the Royal College of Anaesthetists (FRCA).\n\nThe CCT (Certificate of Completion of Training) program in anaesthetics is divided into three levels: basic, intermediate and advanced. During this time, doctors experience anaesthesia as applicable to all surgical specialties. The curriculum focuses on a modular format, with trainees primarily working in one specialist area during the module, for example: cardiac anaesthesia, neuroanaesthesia, ENT, maxillofacial, pain medicine, intensive care, trauma.\n\nTraditionally (before the advent of the Foundation Programme) trainees have entered anaesthetics from other specialties, such as [[medicine]] or [[accident and emergency]]. Specialist training then takes at least seven years.\n\nOn completion of specialist training, doctors are awarded the Certificate of Completion of Training (CCT) and are eligible for entry on the GMC Specialist Register and are able to work as Consultant Anaesthetists. A new consultant in anaesthetics will have completed a minimum of 14 years of training (including: five to six years of medical school; two years of foundation training; and seven years of anesthesia training). It is this level of training that confers the credibility to a CCT holder, referred to as a Consultant in the NHS, and is respected throughout the World.\n\nThose wishing for dual accredit in intensive care are required to undertake an additional year of training and normally complete the Diploma in Intensive Care Medicine (DICM). Pain specialists sit the Fellowship of the Faculty of Pain Medicine of the Royal College of Anaesthetists (FFPMRCA) examination.\n\n===United States===\nAnesthesiologists are the most extensively trained anesthesia providers in the United States.  Anesthesiologists are physicians ([[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] or [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|D.O.]]) who have chosen to specialize in anesthesiology.  Anesthesiologists in the United States must have completed an undergraduate college degree (that includes pre-medical requirements) and, like all other physicians, four years of medical school.  Anesthesiology residency programs in the United States, without exception, require successful completion of four years of residency training for board certification eligibility in the specialty of anesthesiology. An anesthesiology residency requires a one year medical or surgical internship followed by three years of anesthesiology training.  Anesthesiology residents face multiple examinations during their second, third, and fourth years of residency, including exams encompassing physiology, pathophysiology, pharmacology, and other medical sciences addressed in medical school, along with multiple anesthesia knowledge tests which assess progress during residency.  Successful completion of a board exam after completion of residency is required for board certification.\n\nAnesthesiology residency training in the U.S. encompasses the full scope of perioperative medicine, including pre-operative medical evaluation, management of pre-existing disease in the surgical patient, intraoperative life support, intraoperative pain control, post-operative recovery, intensive care medicine, and chronic and acute pain management. After residency, many anesthesiologists complete an additional fellowship year of subspecialty training in areas such as pain management, sleep medicine, [[cardiothoracic anesthesiology]], pediatric anesthesiology, neuro anesthesiology, regional anesthesiology/ambulatory anesthesiology,  obstetric anesthesiology or [[critical care medicine]].\n\nThe majority of anesthesiologists in the United States are board-certified by a specialty medical board; either the [[American Board of Anesthesiology]] (ABA) or the [[American Osteopathic Board of Anesthesiology]] (AOBA).  It should be noted that D.O. anesthesiologists can be certified by the ABA.  The ABA is a member of the American Board of Medical Specialties, while the AOBA falls under the auspices of the [[American Osteopathic Association]]. Both Boards are recognized by the major insurance underwriters in the U.S. as well as by all branches of the U.S. Uniformed Services. Board certification by the ABA involves both a written and an oral examination. AOBA certification requires the same exams, in addition to a practical examination with examining physicians observing the applicant actually administering anesthetics in the operating room.   {{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n* {{dmoz|Health/Medicine/Medical_Specialties/Anesthesiology/|Anesthesiology}}\n* [http://www.openanesthesia.org OpenAnesthesia] \u2014 the Anesthesiology Wiki (presented by the [[International Anesthesia Research Society]])\n\n{{Anesthesia}}\n\n[[Category:Medical doctors by specialty]]\n[[Category:Medical specialties]]\n[[Category:Anesthesia]]\n\n[[sl:Anesteziolog]]", "Doula": "{{Other uses}}\n[[File:Doula (L) with newborn and mother.jpg|thumb|A doula (l) with mother and child]]\n\nA '''doula''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|d|u\u02d0|l|\u0259}}, also known as a labour coach<ref name = idiot>{{cite book | last = Gliksman | first = MI | coauthors = DiGeronimo TF | title = The complete idiot's guide to pregnancy and childbirth | publisher = [[Penguin Books]] | year = 1999 | isbn = 0028631048 | pages = [http://books.google.ca/books?id=TOwtl290Hw0C&pg=PT225#v=onepage&q&f=false 225]}}</ref> and originating from the [[Ancient Greek]] word {{lang|grc|\u03b4\u03bf\u03cd\u03bb\u03b7}} meaning female slave),<ref name = Mander/> is a nonmedical person who assists a woman before, during, or after [[childbirth]], as well as her partner and/or family, by providing physical assistance, and emotional support.<ref name = Balas>{{cite pmid | 15341233}}</ref>  The provision of continuous support during labour, which may be provided by doulas, nurses, family, friends, etc. is associated with improved maternal and fetal health and a variety of other benefits.<ref name = Cochrane/>\n\nCertification and training is offered to doulas, though there is no oversight to their practice and the title can be used by anyone.<ref name = NYT/> The goal of a doula is to ensure the mother feels safe and confident before, during, and after delivery.<ref name = Ballen>{{cite pmid |16620259}}</ref>  Doulas can be controversial within medical settings due to a lack of formal medical education when a discussion regarding [[medical interventions in labor]] versus pursuing [[natural childbirth]] without an [[epidural]] or [[caesarean section]] arises.<ref name = WSJ>{{cite news | title = As 'Doulas' Enter Delivery Rooms, Conflicts Arise:  Hired to Help in Childbirth, They Sometimes Clash With Doctors and Nurses | first = S | last = Hwang | work = [[The Wall Street Journal]]\n| date = 2004-01-19 }}</ref>\n\nSometimes the term ''doula'' can also refer to a nonmedical person who assists critically ill elderly people.<ref name = Balas/>\n\n==History and etymology ==\nThe term \"doula\" was first used in a 1969 [[Anthropology|anthropological study]] <ref>Perspectives on Biology and Medicine</ref> conducted by Dana Raphael.

The patient may be triaged by an emergency physician, a paramedic, or a [[nurse]]; in the United States, triage is usually performed by a [[registered nurse]].

As part of the clinical assessment process they may employ a [[mental status examination]], a [[physical examination]], [[brain imaging]] such as [[computerized tomography]]  (CT/CAT scan), [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), and [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) scanning, and [[blood testing]]. Psychiatrists prescribe medicine, and may also use [[psychotherapy]], although the vast majority do medical management and refer to a [[psychologist]] or another specialized therapist for weekly to bi-monthly psychotherapy.\n\n== Subspecialties ==\nThe field of psychiatry has many subspecialties (also known as Fellowships) that require additional training which are certified by the\u00a0American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology (ABPN) and require Maintenance of Certification Program (MOC) to continue. The following include: \n* [[Clinical neurophysiology]]\n* [[Forensic psychiatry]]\n* [[Addiction psychiatry]]\n* [[Brain Injury Medicine]]\n* [[Child and Adolescent Psychiatry]]\n* [[Geriatric psychiatry]]\n* [[Hospice and palliative medicine]]\n* [[Pain management]]\n* [[Psychosomatic medicine]]( also known as [[Liaison psychiatry|Consultation-liaison psychiatry]])\n* [[Sleep medicine]]\nFurther, other specialties that exist include: <ref name=\"UKReq\" />\n* [[Cross-cultural psychiatry]]\n* [[Emergency psychiatry]]\n* [[Learning disability]]\n* [[Neurodevelopmental disorder]]\n* [[Cognition]] diseases as in various forms of [[dementia]]\n\nSome psychiatrists specialize in helping certain age groups.

This extended period involves comprehensive training in psychiatric diagnosis, psychopharmacology, medical care issues, and psychotherapies.  All accredited psychiatry residencies in the United States require proficiency in [[cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive-behavioral]], brief, psychodynamic, and supportive psychotherapies.  Psychiatry residents are required to complete at least four post-graduate months of internal medicine or pediatrics, plus a minimum of two months of neurology during their first year of residency, referred to as an \"internship\".<ref name=USReq /> After completing their training, psychiatrists are eligible to take a specialty board examination to become board-certified.<ref name=USReq />  The total amount of time required to complete educational and training requirements in the field of psychiatry in the United States is 12 years after high school. Subspecialists in child and adolescent psychiatry are required to complete a two-year fellowship program, the first year of which can run concurrently with the fourth year of the general psychiatry residency program. This adds one to two years of training.\n\n===United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland===\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], psychiatrists must hold a medical degree.<ref>[http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/training/careersinpsychiatry/careerinfoforschoolleavers.aspx Careers info for School leavers<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  These degrees are often abbreviated [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery|MB BChir, MB BCh, MB ChB, BM BS, or MB BS]].  Following this, the individual will work as a [[Foundation House Officer]] for two additional years in the UK, or one year as [[Intern]] in the Republic of Ireland to achieve registration as a basic medical practitioner. Training in psychiatry can then begin and it is taken in two parts: three years of Basic Specialist Training culminating in the MRCPsych exam followed by three years of Higher Specialist Training, referred to as \"ST4-6\" in the UK and \"Senior Registrar Training\" in the Republic of Ireland. Candidates with MRCPsych degree and complete basic training must reinterview for higher specialist training. At this stage, the development of speciality interests such as forensic, child/adolescent take place. At the end of 3 years of higher specialist training, candidates are awarded a CCT (UK) or CCST (Ireland), both meaning Certificate of Completion of (Specialist) Training. At this stage, the psychiatrist can register as a specialist and the qualification of CC(S)T is recognized in all EU/EEA states. As such, training in the UK and Ireland is considerably longer than in the US or Canada and frequently takes around 8\u20139 years following graduation from medical school. Those with a CC(S)T will be able to apply for Consultant posts. Those with training from outside the EU/EEA should consult local medical boards to review their qualifications and eligibility for equivalence recognition (for example, those with a US residency and ABPN qualification).\n\n===Netherlands===\nIn the [[Netherlands]] one must complete [[Medical_school#Netherlands_and_Belgium|medical school]] after which one is certified as a medical doctor. After a strict selection program one can specialize in psychiatry: a 4.5 year specialization. During this specialization, the resident has to do a 6-month residency in the field of social psychiatry, a 12-month residency in a field of their own choice (which can be child psychiatry, forensic psychiatry, somatic medicine or medical research).  To become an adolescent psychiatrist, one has to do an extra specialization period of 2 more years. In short this means that it takes at least 10.5 years of study to become a psychiatrist which can go up to 12.5 years if one becomes a children's and adolescent psychiatrist.\n\n== See also ==\n{{columns\n|width = 22em\n|col1 =\n*[[List of famous figures in psychiatry]]\n*[[List of psychiatrists]]\n*[[Medicine]]\n|col2 =\n*[[Mental health]]\n*[[Mental health professional]]\n*[[Mental illness]]\n|col3 =\n*[[Psychiatry]]\n*[[Psychiatric nursing]]\n*[[Clinical psychology]]\n*[[Psychologist]]\n*[[Psychology]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* American Psychiatric Association.

Under the national law, registration of psychologists is administered by the Psychology Board of Australia (PsyBA).<ref>[http://www.psychologyboard.gov.au/ Psychology Board of Australia].

The standard route to full membership (MAPS) of the APS technically requires a masters or doctoral degree in psychology in an accredited course. An alternate route is available for academics and practitioners who have gained appropriate experience and made substantial contribution to the field of psychology. Association membership requires four years of APAC accredited undergraduate study.\n\nRestrictions apply to all who want to use the title 'psychologist' in any form in all states and territories of Australia. However, the terms 'psychotherapist', 'social worker', and 'counselor' are currently self-regulated with several organizations campaigning for government regulation.<ref>e.g. [[Australian Counseling Association]] and [[Psychotherapy and Counseling Federation of Australia]]</ref>\n\n===Belgium===\nIn Belgium, the title \"psychologist\" is protected by law since 1993. It can only be used by people who are included as such on the list of a national government commission. The minimum requirement is a completed five years university training in psychology (Master's degree or equivalent). The title of \"psychotherapist\" is not legally protected (yet).\n\n===Finland===\nIn [[Finland]], the title \"psychologist\" is protected by law. Restriction is governed by [[National Supervisory Authority for Welfare and Health (Finland)]]. It takes 330 ECTS-credits (about six years) to accomplish the studies.\n\n===Germany===\nIn [[Germany]], the use of the title 'Diplom-Psychologe' is restricted by law, and a practitioner is legally required to hold the corresponding academic title, which is comparable to a higher MSc degree and requires up to five years of training.  With the current reforms, this degree will be replaced by a lower master's degree and a new [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D. in psychology]].\nThe academic degree of Diplom-Psychologe does not include a psychotherapeutical qualification, which requires three to five years of additional training.  The psychotherapeutical  training combines in-depth theoretical knowledge with supervised patient care and self-reflection units. After having completed the training requirements, psychologists take a state-run exam, which, upon successful completion, confers the official title of 'psychological psychotherapist' (psychologischer Psychotherapeut). {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n===Greece===\nIn Greece, the title \"psychologist\" has been protected by law since 1979. It can only be used by people who hold a relevant licence to practice as a psychologist.

The Dutch professional association of psychologists (NIP), using trademark law, therefore posited its own title \"Psychologist NIP\" (Psycholoog NIP), which is granted exclusively to holders of a Masters degree in psychology, after a year of postgraduate experience.\nThe titles \"psychotherapist\" (psychotherapeut) and \"healthcare psychologist\" (gz-psycholoog / gezondheidszorgpsycholoog) are restricted through the Individual Healthcare Professions Act (wet BIG) to those who have followed further postgraduate (PsyD/DPsych or Licentiate level) training. The use of the titles \"clinical psychologist\" (klinisch psycholoog) and clinical neuropsychologist (klinisch neuropsycholoog) is reserved for those who have followed specialist post-licentiate training.\n\n===New Zealand===\nIn New Zealand, the use of the title \"psychologist\" is restricted by law. Prior to 2004, only the title \"Registered Psychologist\" was restricted (to people qualified and registered as such). However with the proclamation of the Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003, the use of the title \"Psychologist\" was limited to practitioners registered with the New Zealand Psychologists Board. (The titles \"Clinical Psychologist\", \"Counselling Psychologist\", \"Educational Psychologist\", \"Intern Psychologist\", and \"Trainee Psychologist\" are similarly protected.) This is to protect the public by providing assurance that the title user is registered and therefore qualified, competent, and can be held accountable for their practice. The legislation does not currently include an exemption clause for any class of practitioner (e.g., academics, or government employees).\n\n===South Africa===\nIn [[South Africa]],<ref>Sourced from the Departments of Psychology: [http://web.uct.ac.za/depts/psychology/ University of Cape Town], [http://www.wits.ac.za/umthombo/psychology/7311/home.html University of the Witwatersrand], [http://www.unisa.ac.za/Default.asp?Cmd=ViewContent&ContentID=14025 University of South Africa]</ref> psychologists are qualified in one of Clinical-, Counselling-, Educational-, Organisational- or Research Psychology.  To attain the qualification, one must complete a recognised [[Masters degree]] in Psychology and an appropriate [[practicum]] at a recognised training institution, and also sit an examination set by the Professional Board for Psychology.<ref>[http://www.hpcsa.co.za/board_psychology.php Professional Board for Psychology].

Retrieved on 2011-11-22.</ref> is required, and includes a [[Continuing Professional Development]] component. The practicum usually involves a full year [[internship]], and in some specializations the HPCSA requires completion of an additional year of [[community service]]. The Master's comprises [[seminar]]- and [[coursework]]-based theoretical and practical [[training]], and a [[dissertation]] of limited scope, and is (in most cases) two years in duration.  Prior to enrolling for the Master\u2019s, the student will have studied psychology for three years as an undergraduate ([[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] or [[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc.]], and, for Organisational Psychology, also [[Bachelor of Commerce|B.Com.]]), followed by an additional [[postgraduate]] [[Bachelor's degree#South Africa|honours degree]] in psychology; see [[List of universities in South Africa]]. Qualification thus requires at least five years of study, and at least one of internship.\n\n===Sweden===\nIn Sweden the title \"psychologist\" is restricted in law. It can only be used after receiving a license from the government. The basic requirements are a completed five years specialised course in psychology (equivalent of a Master's degree) and 12 months of practice under supervision. All other uses are banned, though often challenged.\n\"Psychotherapist\" follows similar rules but the basic educational demands are another 1.5 years (spread out over three years) at a specialised course in psychotherapy (that do vary a lot concerning theoretical footing), in addition to an academical level degree within a field concerning the treatment of people (psychologist, social worker, [[psychiatrist]] a.s.o.). Others than psychologist usually have to complete their education with basic courses in psychotherapy to meet the demands for the applied psychotherapy classes.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nIn the UK the following titles are restricted by law: \"registered psychologist\" and \"practitioner psychologist\"; in addition the following specialist titles are restricted by law: \"clinical psychologist\", \"counselling psychologist\", \"educational psychologist\", \"forensic psychologist\", \"health psychologist\", \"occupational psychologist\" and \"sport and exercise psychologist\".<ref>[http://www.hpc-uk.org/apply/psychologists/ HPC \u2013 Health Professions Council \u2013 Becoming registered as a practitioner psychologist].

Perhaps the most significant difference is that psychiatrists are licensed [[physicians]]. As such, psychiatrists often use the [[medical model]] to assess mental health problems and rely on [[psychoactive drug|psychotropic medications]] as the chief method of addressing mental health problems<ref>{{cite journal|author=Graybar, S. and Leonard, L. |year=2005|journal=American Journal of Psychotherapy|volume=59|issue=1|pages= 1\u201319}}</ref>\u2014although many also employ psychotherapy as well. Clinical psychologists receive extensive training in psychological test administration, scoring, interpretation and reporting. These tests help to inform diagnostic decisions and treatment planning.  For example, in a medical center, a patient with a complicated clinical presentation who is being seen by a psychiatrist might be referred to a clinical psychologist for psychological testing to aid in diagnosis and treatment.  In addition, psychologists (particularly those from PhD programs) spend several years in graduate school being trained to conduct behavioral research, including research design and advanced statistical analysis.  While this training is available for physicians via dual MD/PhD programs, it is not typically included in medical education.\n\nPsychologists generally do not prescribe medication, although there is a growing movement for clinical psychologists to have limited prescribing privileges. Clinical and other psychologists are experts at psychotherapy (typically clinical psychologists are trained in a number of psychological therapies, including, behavioural, cognitive, humanistic, existential, psychodynamic, and systemic approaches), and [[psychological testing]] (e.g. including [[neuropsychological test]]ing). In two US states, specifically New Mexico and Louisiana, some psychologists with post-doctoral pharmacology training have been granted [[RxP|prescriptive authority]] for certain mental health disorders upon agreement with the patient's physician.<ref>{{cite web | title = Louisiana grants psychologists prescriptive authority | url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/louisianarx.html | date = 5 May 2004 | accessdate = 16 July 2009}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of psychologists]]\n* [[Psychology]]\n* [[Psychiatry]]\n* [[Psychiatrist]]\n* [[Mental health professional]]\n* [[List of psychological topics]]\n* [[List of psychologists on postage stamps]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=35em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Spoken Wikipedia|Psychologist.ogg|2006-12-17}}\n* [http://www.efpa.eu European Federation of Psychologists' Associations]\n* [http://www.nationalpsychologist.com/ The National Psychologist], an independent bi-monthly newspaper for behavioral healthcare practitioners\n* [http://dictionary-psychology.com Psychology terms]\n* [http://www.apa.org/index.aspx American Psychological Association]\n* [http://www.hkadcp.com.hk Hong Kong Association of Doctors in Clinical Psychology]\n\n{{Psychology}}\n\n[[Category:Psychologists]]\n[[Category:Mental health professionals]]\n[[Category:Psychology]]\n[[Category:Wikipedia articles needing clarification]]\n\n[[ko:\uc2ec\ub9ac\ud559]]", "Endocrinologist": "#redirect [[Endocrinology]]", "Hematologist": "#REDIRECT [[Hematology]]", "Sonographer": "'''Sonographers''' are [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic]] [[medical professional]]s who operate [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasonic]] imaging devices to produce diagnostic images, scans, videos, or 3D volumes of anatomy and diagnostic data.
