{"Faith community nursing": "{{linkrot|date=January 2014}}\n{{no footnotes|date=January 2014}}\n{{Refimprove|date=June 2012}}\n\n'''Faith Community Nursing''', also known as '''Parish Nursing''', '''Parrish Nursing''', '''Congregational Nursing''' or '''Church Nursing''', is a movement of over 15,000 [[registered nurse]]s, primarily in the [[United States]].\n<ref>American Nurses Association (2012). Retrieved from www.nursingworld.org on April 15, 2012.</ref>  There are also Parish nurses in [[Australia]], the Bahamas, Canada, England, Ghana, India, Kenya, [[Korea]], Madagascar, Malawi, Malaysia, [[New Zealand]], Nigeria, Palestine, Pakistan, Scotland, Singapore, [[South Africa]], [[Swaziland]], Ukraine, Wales, Zambia and [[Zimbabwe]].  Faith community nursing is a practice specialty that focuses on the intentional care of the spirit, promotion of an integrative model of health and prevention and minimization of illness within the context of a [[community of faith]]. The intentional integration of the practice of faith with the practice of [[nursing]] so that people can achieve wholeness in, with, and through the population which faith community nurses serve.\n\nParish nursing began in the mid-1980s in Chicago through the efforts of Rev. Dr. [[Granger E. Westberg|Granger Westberg]] as a reincarnation of the faith community nursing outreach done by religious orders, such as the \"Parish Deaconesses\" in Europe and America in the 1800s.  Parish nursing is rooted in the Judeo-Christian tradition, and the historic practice of professional nursing, and is consistent with the basic assumptions of many faiths that we care for self and others as an expression of God's love. However, it is not only available to Christian congregations.  There are Jewish Congregational Nurses, Muslim Crescent Nurses, and RNs serving in similar capacities within other faith traditions.\n\nFaith Community Nursing (FCN) is recognized as a [[Nursing specialties|specialty nursing practice]]. ''Faith Community Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice'' was approved by the [[American Nurses Association]] in 2005 (and updated in 2012) and define the specialty as \"...the specialized practice of professional nursing that focuses on the intentional care of the spirit as part of the process of promoting holistic health and preventing or minimizing illness in a faith community.\" (American Nurses Association, 2012, Faith Community Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, Silver Springs, MD: Author, p1). The 16 standards of Faith Community Nursing Practice reflect the specialty's professional values and priorities and provide practice directions and the framework for practice evaluation.  Each standard is measurable by a set of specific competencies that serve as evidence of minimal compliance with that standard.\n\nTo become a faith community nurse, the registered nurse must have a minimum of 2 years experience, must have a current license in the state where the faith community is located, and have completed a parish nurse foundations course for the specialty practice as recognized by the American Nurses Association.  There are several different curriculum offerings for the faith community nurse which have been developed by a panel of nursing faculty.  These are offered though a partnership with the International Parish Nurse Resource Center (IPNRC) at more than 130 nursing schools and health systems around the US and abroad.\n\nFaith community nurses serve in several roles, including:\n\u2022\tHealth advisor\n\u2022\tEducator on health issues\n\u2022\tVisitor of church members at home or in the hospital\n\u2022\tProvider of referrals to community resources and provide assistance in obtaining needed health services\n\u2022\tDeveloper of support groups within the church\n\u2022\tTrainer and coordinator of volunteers\n\u2022\tProvider of health screenings\n\nIt is important to note that faith community nurses are not expected to provide patient care in the church or at a patient's home but rather to be a source of referrals for services in the community.  They coordinate existing services and supplement them with a holistic dimension of health and caring.\nA parish nurse program or faith community nurse program can operate in several different ways.  Models include: 1) one church supporting its own full or part-time nurse, 2) several churches supporting one nurse, 3) a group of volunteer nurses supporting one or several churches or 4) a nurse related to a hospital or clinic who supports a church or churches as part of his or her job.  Of the several thousand faith community nurses, only about 35% in the US are compensated financially for their ministry.\nIn the United States, faith community nurses typically belong to the Health Ministries Association which is the national professional membership organization for faith community nurses.  They also have available the International Parish Nurse Resource Center and the American Nurses Association, among others.\n\nThe Caribbean has joined the community of Parish Nursing and Health Care Ministry with the launching of Health Care Ministry in The Bahamas.  It began with an initial course spanning a three-week period and brought together nurses from various denominations who were commissioned on 27 February 2005. Initially, the Canadian and Australian models of Parish Nursing were introduced to The Bahamas as an extension of the Pastoral Care Ministries of Diocese 2000 & Beyond, a programme of the Anglican Diocese of The Bahamas and Turks & Caicos Islands. To date, more than 60 people have been trained and actively engaged in the ministry as either Parish Nurses or Health & Wellness Carers.    \n\nSince the ministry began in 2005 it has grown steadily and was known as the Anglican Diocesan Health Care Ministry [Parish Nursing] Council.  However, effective 7 March 2008 the name changed to the Ecumenical Health Care Ministry Council. It is intended that there will be continued training and that the programme will spread throughout the Commonwealth of The Bahamas and the Caribbean.  To this end, the ministry will be recognised by the Bahamas Christian Council and by extension the Caribbean Council of Churches.

There are a number of different kinds of surgical nurse, and '''surgical nursing''' as a career can be very demanding. Compensation in this field varies, depending on where a nurse works. Some surgical nurses make salaries which are comparable to those of doctors, while others struggle to get by on much less.\n\nIn pre-operative care, a surgical nurse helps to prepare a patient for surgery, both physically and emotionally. Surgical nurses may explain the procedure to the patient, and ease fears about the upcoming surgery and recovery. They also check the patient's vitals, administer medications, and help to sterilize and mark the surgical site.\n\nDuring surgery, a surgical nurse assists the surgeon, passing instruments, keeping an eye on the patient's vital signs, and performing other tasks associated with the surgery, such as providing suction at the surgical site to remove blood and fluids. Some surgical nurses work as circulating nurses, patrolling the operating room to make sure that everyone stays sterile, and counting instruments, drapes, and other equipment to ensure that everything is where it is supposed to be. Nurses who are skilled at operating room work tend to receive excellent compensation, especially if particular surgeons become attached to them.\n\nPost-operative care is also a critical part of the work of a surgical nurse. Nurses can work in acute recovery, keeping an eye on patients who are at serious risk of complications, and on more standard recovery floors in the hospital. They are usually responsible for changing dressings, monitoring vital signs, looking for signs of complications, and administering medications. The care of an attentive surgical nurse ensures that a patient's recovery goes as smoothly as possible.\n\nPeople who want to become surgical nurses attend nursing school and specialize in surgical nursing. They are often required to pass examinations administered by the government or by nursing certification boards before being allowed to work as nurses, and they may also be expected to attend periodic continuing education classes so that they keep up with developments in the nursing field.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nSurgical patients (those who have undergone a minor or major [[surgical procedure]]) are nursed on different wards to medical patients in the UK and Australia. Nursing practice on surgical wards differs from that of medical wards.\n\nSurgical nurses may practice in different types of surgery:\n\n*[[General surgery]] (e.g. [[appendectomy]], gallbladder removal)\n*[[Vascular surgery]] (e.g. varicose vein surgery, aortic aneurysm repair)\n*[[Colo-rectal surgery]] (e.g. [[stoma (medicine)|stoma]] formation)\n*[[Surgical Oncology]] (e.g. breast surgery, tumour resections)\n*[[Orthopaedic surgery]] (e.g. knee or hip replacements, fracture repair)\n*[[Urological surgery]] (e.g. prostate surgery)\n*[[Day surgery]] (or ambulatory surgery, where a patient is discharged within 24 hours)\n\nSurgical nurses are responsible for approximately six patients, depending on the nature of the surgical ward. Intensive Care and High-Dependency units usually have one to two nurses per patient.\n\n== Duties ==\n\n===Pre-operatively===\n\nPreparation of patients for their procedure involves ensuring pre-medication is administered, the patient/guardian has given written consent, the required blood-tests have been done, identification labels and identification bracelets are correct, all allergies have been recorded in the patient's notes and that the patient has been fasted appropriately\n\n===Post-operatively===\n\nPost-operatively the patient must be closely observed for signs of shock, arrest.  The surgical nurse also ensures the wound created by the surgery is intact, and must be knowledgeable in [[Wound|wound care]] and the care of surgical drains. Surgical Nurses are responsible for the management of  pain and post-operative nausea and vomiting, which are common post-operative side effects. The surgical nurse is also responsible  for the discharge of the patient and giving the patient information on support systems and measures necessary to their recovery.\n\n== Credentials ==\n\nTo become a surgical nurse,CCTC one must have undertaken appropriate training, and be registered with the state nursing board ([[Nursing and Midwifery Council]], UK; [[An Bord Altranais]], Rep. of Ireland).

Due to their complexity, aged people always deserve personal attention. Nurses address physical, psycho social, cultural and family concerns as well as promoting health and emphasizing successful aging.\n\nRising [[Life expectancy]] creates a need for the preparation of nurses to care for the rapidly increasing number of the aged.\n\nIt is important to distinguish changes involved with normal aging from changes attributable to [[pathophysiology]]. Alterations in the structure and function of multiple body system may affect an older person's appearance, mobility and ability to fight off infections. Geriatric medications require careful management to avoid overmedication as this group receives a lot of medication (see [[polypharmacy]]. Multiple medications can cause a variety of [[drug interaction]] in older people. Primary drug reaction occurs when one drug causes one side effect, secondary drug reaction occurs when one medication reacts with another. Older people should be treated in ways that are of benefit and do no harm or as little harm as possible. Principle of assessment: data regarding biomedical, functional, psychological and social issues are obtained to help in planning and implementation of individual health care.\n\n==Pressure injuries==\nA [[pressure ulcer]] is a [[lesion]] caused by unrelieved external pressure resulting from [[Vascular occlusion|occlusion]] of the blood flow, tissue ischemia and cell death. Pressure ulcers are often viewed as a complication of an [[acute (medicine)|acute]] or [[chronic illness]]. The high prevalence of pressure ulcers, especially facility-acquired pressure ulcers, is a concern in patient care today. While rates have decreased in some care settings, 1 in 10 patients in acute care still experience a pressure ulcer and almost 1 in 20 patients develop a facility-acquired pressure ulcer.<ref>http://www.hill-rom.com/usa/Clinical-Resources/Pressure-Ulcer-Management--/Quality-Measures/</ref> The presence of ulcers may also be evidence of poor nursing care. Although pressure ulcers can be prevented, they may also occur despite optimal nursing care and advanced technologies. To provide effective nursing care for the older adult with pressure ulcers, the nurse must approach patient care within a holistic frame work. This framework should include an integration of good assessment, use of research-based intervention and methodical intervention of patience outcomes. Some specific issues of prevention, assessment and treatment of adult with pressure ulcers are aging skin: The older people have an aged skin and due to exposure to the sun the skin wrinkles, epidermis thins, blood vessels recede, [[dermal]]-[[Epidermis (skin)|epidermal]] [[dermal ridge|ridges]] flatten and the skin appears thin and fragile. The age related changes may lead to ulceration. The skin which is the largest organ can help in viewing the overall functioning of the entire body. All clinicians working with older people at risk for, or suffering from pressure ulcers must be mindful of these varying relationships in using the cutaneous  \"window\" of person to plan and implement individualized, comprehensive care.\n\nPressure ulcers are catogorized by a staging scheme.  Stage one ulcers are characterized by non-blancherble [[erythema]] of intact skin. Stage one pressure ulcers are difficult to identify in darkly pigmented people and are usually indicated by discoloration, warmth, [[endyma]], [[induration]]s and hardness. Stage two ulcers are partial [[lesion]]s extending into the epidermis and the dermis. Stage three ulcers are defined as the full thickness skin loss. Stage four is characterized by extensive tissue damage which extends to the muscle, bone or the underlying structures.\n\nThrough a holistic assessment and evaluation a nurse can build a plan of care for those patients who suffer from [[pressure injury]]. When treating an ulcer treatment should focus on wound healing. For a [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]], non healing ulcer, comfort should be a top priority. Positioning and padding can reduce the risk of pressure ulcers. Wound healing occurs only if; the patient is physiologically able to provide needed substrate; wound cleanliness is maintained, moisture and infection are controlled and the cause of injury is removed. Older people take longer to heal so extra care is needed. When customary interventions fail to heal a pressure ulcer, surgical intervention may be an option.\n\n==Cardiovascular disease==\nCardiovascular disease affects the [[heart]] and the [[blood vessels]]. It is caused by disruption in the [[blood circulation]] secondary to decreased vessel patency (constriction, spasm and [[Vascular occlusion|occlusion]]). Cardiovascular disease is occurs in 50% of the population over the age of 65, and accounts for 40% of deaths in this group. Because of the changes associated with normal aging and some of the unique aspects of reporting and [[presenting]] in older adults, underestimation of the seriousness of cardiac disease occurs. This can lead to misdiagnosis, under treatment, and even death. There are different kinds of heart disease: [[Atherosclerosis]] and [[arteriosclerosis]]. Arteriosclerosis is a disease of the [[arteries]], characterized by abnormal thickening and hardening of vessel walls, it leads to atherosclerosis. When diagnosing look for cases of fainting, continuous chest pain, nausea, shortness of breath, rapid heart rate, rapid weight gain, pain in the abdomen, swelling of legs and other symptoms. Issues of [[hypertension]], high [[blood cholesterol]], [[diabetes]], [[obesity]] and overweight, [[smoking]], hereditary should be addressed. Treatment includes medication and physical exercises.\n\n==Respiratory issues==\nThe following age related changes may occur in the respiratory system of an older person: diminished muscle strength in the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] and [[thorax]], stiffer [[chest wall]], decreased [[elastic recoil]], decreased elasticity in the [[alveoli]] reduced surface area, with diminished capacity for [[gas exchange]], decreased vital capacity, and drier [[mucous membrane]] leading to more difficulty in [[mucus|mucous]] [[excretion]]. X-ray studies and physical examination aid in evaluating pulmonary function. Respiratory diseases in older people include; [[bronchitis]], [[asthma]], [[pneumonia]], [[tuberculosis]], and [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]]. Some of these lead to cardiovascular disease related to [[air pollution]]. Nurses should draw a plan for treatment which includes working with other specialties like heart experts.\n\n==Genitourinary issues==\nThey include [[urinary incontinence]] (transient, established or combination), [[urinary tract infection]] ([[asymptomatic bacteriuria]], uncomplicated UTI and complicated UTI) and [[prostate disease]] ([[benign prostatic hyperplasia]]) and [[prostate cancer]]. Nurses should be careful with the language while carrying diagnosis so they can obtain as much information as possible.\n\n==Diabetes mellitus==\n[[Diabetes mellitus]] is a [[metabolic disorder]] with two major types, type one and type two. Their end result is [[hyperglycemia]]. Type one is caused by lack of [[insulin production]] by beta cells. Type two is the most common and is caused by deficiency or inadequacy of insulin receptors in cells. Treatment goals are to symptoms and maintain as normal [[blood glucose]] as possible without inducing [[hypoglycemia]] to decrease the risk of long term complications. Nurse should emphasize [[nutrition]] and [[exercise]] which are vital for victims. For older people monitoring for complications which can lead to [[lower extremity]] [[amputation]], [[hypertension]], [[myocardial infarction]], stroke, [[vision loss]], or [[nephropathy]] should be carried out especially in type 2 diabetic patient.\n\n==Thyroid==\nThe most encountered disorders are [[hyperthyroidism]], [[hypothyroidism]] and [[nodular thyroid disease]]. Hyperthyroidism is characterized by an excess of amount of thyroid hormone. In hypothyroidism the thyroid glands fails to produce thyroid hormone. Nurse practitioners have a responsibility to evaluate and manage thyroid disorders by applying strategies specific to older adults.\n\n==Delirium==\nAlso known as acute confusion, it is a prevalent and serious health problem for acutely ill adults. Delirium can be defined as [[wikt:transient|transient]] and [[etiological]] non-specific organic mental [[syndrome]] characterized by reduced ability to focus, sustain or shift attention.\n\n==Dizziness==\nChanges in the structure and function of the nervous system occur with normal aging and can result in changes in mobility, [[balance (ability)|balance]], [[motor coordination|coordination]], sensation, [[Understanding|comprehension]], [[cognitive performance]] or [[behaviour]]. These changes reflect a slowing of neurological response as fewer neurons are available to provide sensory and motor messages to and from the central nervous system. Common terms for dizziness include vertigo, pre-syncope and disequilibrium.\n\n==Stroke==\nAlso known as brain attack, created by interruption of blood supply to some areas of the brain, this interruption can occur as a result of an [[Vascular occlusion|occlusion]] or [[hemorrhage]].

A nurse who specializes in this area is usually referred to as a '''pediatric nurse'''. Although there are many regional and sub-specialty variations in title. The spelling '''paediatric nursing''' is more common in English-speaking countries outside the United States.\n\n==Training of Pediatric Nurses==\nPediatric nurses often receive general exposure to pediatrics during their undergraduate degree or other basic qualification before gaining additional experience and \"in-service\" training once they start work in their chosen area. A wide range of post-graduate qualifications in various pediatric sub-specialties are available.\n\nIn the past more specific pediatric nursing training programs existed which prepared nurses to care for infants and children only, and not for a more general patient population which included adults. The increasing popularity of general or \"comprehensive\" training has seen a decline in such programs, though they still exist in some parts of the world.\n\n==How to become a Pediatric Nurse==\nWhile education in the healthcare field is very important, you do not need to go to college to become a pediatric nurse. Many registered nurses today work in the field for awhile and later pursue a baccalaureate degree. There are multiple vocational programs that offer training for the NCLEX-RN (National Council Licensure Examination-Registered Nurse). Once you become a registered nurse, you can specialize in Pediatry.\n\n==Why Pediatric Nursing is Important==\nPediatric nursing is a specialized field of nursing that deals exclusively with children. Children ages 0 to 17 make up about 25% of the world's population. This is a significant number! Pediatric nurses know how to care for and communicate with children. Pediatric nurses have a drive and a passion to keep children happy and healthy. \n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Nursing}}\n*''[[Paediatric Nursing]]'', related journal\n* [[Child survival]], related field of public health\n\n==References==\n\nSmith, Cheryl M. and Hamner, Jenny B. \u201cBringing Pediatric Nursing to Life in a Baccalaureate Curriculum.\u201d Journal of Nursing Education 47.5 (2008): 236-9.

As a field, it is part of [[telehealth]], and has many points of contacts with other medical and non-medical applications, such as [[telediagnosis]], teleconsultation, telemonitoring, etc.\n\nTelenursing is achieving a large rate of growth in many countries, due to several factors: the preoccupation in driving down the costs of health care, an increase in the number of [[aging]] and chronically ill population, and the increase in coverage of health care to distant, rural, small or sparsely populated regions. Among its many benefits, telenursing may help solve increasing shortages of nurses; to reduce distances and save travel time, and to keep patients out of hospital. A greater degree of job satisfaction has been registered among telenurses.<ref>[http://www.e-health-insider.com/news/item.cfm?ID=1263 Nurses Happier Using Telecare, Says International Survey], eHealth Insider website, 15 June 2005, retrieved 2009-04-04;</ref>\n\n== Applications ==\n{{Globalize|section|date=December 2009}}\n\n=== Home Care ===\nOne of the most distinctive telenursing applications is [[home care]]. For example, patients who are immobilized, or live in remote or difficult to reach places, citizens who have chronic ailments, such as [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], [[diabetes]], congestive [[heart disease]], or debilitating diseases, such as neural degenerative diseases ([[Parkinson's disease]], [[Alzheimer's disease]] or [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]]), may stay at home and be \"visited\" and assisted regularly by a nurse via [[videoconferencing]], internet or [[videophone]]. Other applications of home care are the care of patients in immediate post-surgical situations, the care of wounds, [[ostomy|ostomies]] or  [[Disability|disabled]] individuals. In normal home health care, one nurse is able to visit up to 5-7 patients per day.  Using telenursing, one nurse can \u201cvisit\u201d 12-16 patients in the same amount of time.\n\n=== Case Management ===\nA common application of telenursing is also used by [[call center]]s operated by [[managed care organization]]s, which are staffed by [[registered nurse]]s who act as [[Case management (USA health system)|case managers]] or perform patient [[triage]], information and counseling as a means of regulating patient access and flow and decrease the use of emergency rooms.\n\n=== Telephone triage ===\nTelephone triage refers to symptom or clinically-based calls.  Clinicians perform symptom assessment by asking detailed questions about the patient's illness or injury. The clinician's task is to estimate and/or rule out urgent symptoms. They may use pattern recognition and other problem-solving process as well.  Clinicians may utilize guidelines, in paper or electronic format, to determine how urgent the symptoms are. Telephone triage requires clinicians to determine if the symptoms are life-threatening, emergent, urgent, acute or non-acute.  It may involve educating and advising clients, and making safe, effective, and appropriate dispositions\u2014all by telephone. Telephone triage takes place in settings as diverse as emergency rooms, large call centers, physician offices, clinics, student health centers and hospices.\n\n== Legal, ethical and regulatory issues ==\nTelenursing is fraught with legal, [[ethics|ethical]] and regulatory issues, as it happens with telehealth as a whole. In many countries, interstate and intercountry practice of telenursing is forbidden (the attending nurse must have a license both in their state/country of residence and in the state/country where the patient receiving telecare is located). The [[Nurse Licensure Compact]] helps resolve some of these jurisdiction issues.   Legal issues such as [[accountability]] and [[malpractice]], etc. are also still largely unsolved and difficult to address.\n\nIn addition, there are many considerations related to patient [[confidentiality]] and safety of clinical data.\n\n== References ==\n\n;Notes\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n;Bibliography\n\n* ''Telenursing: Nursing Practice in Cyberspace''.

The progress of integration continued to be slow and limited. By fall of 2005, only 30% of academic nursing programs contained a curriculum thread in [[genetics]] and [[genomics]].<ref name=\"Establishing competencies\" /> One of the leading factors in the limited progress of [[genetics]] integration is the relevance to all nursing practice is not fully appreciated by many, and [[genetics]] is also seen by many nurses to be a [[subspecialty]].

The main aspect of the [[U.K.]]\u2019s strategy was simplicity. They achieved this by constructing seven essential competencies that were applied to the entire nursing profession. In 2003, the U.K. National Health Service created the NHS National Genetics Education and Development Centre. The main functions of these programs were to enhance [[genetics]] education and to dispense materials and resources for educators of all [[Genetics|genetic]] professions. The [[United States]] mirrored the efforts and ideas established in the [[U.K.]] and adopted similar methods and competencies.The [[U.S]] National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIGH) united to initiate strategies, training programs, committees, and define the competencies.<ref name=\"Establishing competencies\" />\n\n==Competencies==\n\n===Development===\nThe [[Genetics|genetic]] and [[genomic]] competencies are important to the practice of all [[nurses]] regardless of academic preparation, practice setting, role, or specialty.<ref name=competencies>{{cite book|last=Consensus|title=Essentials of Genetic and Genomic Nursing: Competencies, Curricula Guidelines, and Outcome Indicators, 2nd Edition|year=2009|publisher=American Nurses Association|location=Silver Spring, MD|isbn=1-55810-263-9|pages=11\u201314|url=http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Careers/HealthProfessionalEducation/geneticscompetency.pdf}}</ref> The competencies are significant because they establish a foundation and set of guidelines for the nursing workforce on administering the minimal amount of [[Genetics|genetic]] and [[genomic]] based healthcare. Since the competencies would only reflect the minimalist amount of [[Genetics|genetic]] and [[genomic]] based healthcare, they were specifically drawn up to focus on the scope of practice for [[registered nurses]]. This was done because a [[registered nurse]] is a general level of practice for nursing and requires that one has graduated from a college or university nursing program and has passed the [[NCLEX]]. The [[NCLEX]] is a national licensing exam that signifies minimal competency in practicing nursing if passed.<ref name=\"Establishing competencies\" /><ref name=competencies /><ref name=oxford>{{cite web|title=Oxford Dictionaries|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/registered%2Bnurse|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=22 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nTo begin the development of the competencies, the initial strategy of the [[U.S]] National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIGH) established the Steering Committee. The Steering Committee was composed of nurse leaders from a variety of professional nursing agencies, academic settings, and organizations. Two of the major nursing leaders, Jean Jenkins, RN, PhD, FAAN and Kathleen Calzone, RN, MSN, APNG, FAAN were chosen as the Co-Chairs of the committee. The committee's fundamental function was to generate a mechanism for establishing competencies by recognizing, examining, and comparing existing published competencies.<ref name=\"Establishing competencies\" /><ref name=competencies /> The published competencies that were being examined targeted all health care professionals, specifically those practicing [[genetics]], nurses with bachelor\u2019s degrees, and [[advanced practice nurses]]. After the published competencies were reviewed carefully, the developing of the essential competencies was produced in four phases called the process of consensus.\n\nDuring phase I of the process of consensus, a subset of the committee was created to synthesize competencies from the documents under review that would apply to all registered nurses; then the steering committee reviewed, modified, and approved the recommended competencies.<ref name=\"Establishing competencies\" /> In 2005, nurse representatives of the National Coalition for Health Professional Education in Genetics (NCHPEG) also reviewed the proposed competencies and made modifications. Throughout phase II, the American Nursing Association (ANA) published the competencies during a meeting in 2006 and requested judgment, thoughts, and comments from the public, specifically targeting the insight from the nursing community.<ref name=\"Establishing competencies\" /><ref name=competencies /> The 10 comments that were received were recorded and evaluated and the majority of them showed support. Phase III consisted of establishing consensus on the final draft of the essential competencies by the Steering Committee and the Consensus Panel, which is also made up of a variety of nursing leaders in different organizations and settings.<ref name=\"Establishing competencies\" /> The Steering Committee also constructed strategies for integrating [[Genetics|genetic]] and [[genomic]] information into education and practice such as the [[NCLEX]] exam, accreditation programs, certification processes, and nursing curriculum. In March 2006, phase IV occurred and consisted of endorsing the final document by the Nursing Organizations Alliance member organizations.<ref name=competencies />\n\n===Essential Competencies===\nThe essential competencies consists of two domains: professional responsibilities and professional practice. Under the professional responsibilities domain, all professional activities by [[registered nurses]] are required to fall within the confines of the ''Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice''

of human actions, motives, and conduct. Complicated ethical issues in areas such as justice, privacy, and autonomy, tend to follow both the field of [[genetics]] and the field of [[nursing]]. Ethical problems and dilemmas arise daily in healthcare settings for both the patient and health care provider. For example, all patients and individuals have the right to receive equal health care regardless of gender, religious beliefs, status, or race.  A Code of Ethics for Nursing was created by the American Nurses Association (ANA), which provides rules, regulations, and guidelines to follow when making a decision that is ethical based. These regulations were mainly established to help provide equal healthcare, protect the rights, safety, and privacy of the patient, and to hold [[nurses]] accountable for their actions and choices. [[Genetics]] can create ethical issues in nursing for a variety of different situations. Many scenarios, questions, and debates have been encountered such as what individuals can receive [[Genetics|genetic]] testing or information? Who owns or controls the information received from the genetic test and how can the owner use that information? However, the code of [[ethics]] does not address [[genetics]] or [[genomics]] specifically, so ethical foundations were also established to help guide [[genetics]] into health care. The foundations provide a set of guidelines to understand and manage an ethical issue if one should arise, and to assist in the translation of [[genetics]] into the healthcare environment.<ref name=ethics>{{cite journal|last=Badzek|first=Laurie|coauthors=Mark Henaghan, Martha Turner, Rita Monsen|title=Ethical, Legal, and Social Issues in the Translation of Genomics Into Health Care|journal=Journal of Nursing Scholarship|date=January 31, 2013|year=2012|month=September|doi=10.1111/jnu.12000|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/jnu.12000/asset/jnu.12000.pdf?v=1&t=hdi0qtm8&s=4b663d0e7667a558e0bbd6b2e1583e77d08d643a&systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+disrupted+on+23+February+from+10%3A00-12%3A00+BST+%2805%3A00-07%3A00+EDT%29+for+essential+maintenance|accessdate=23 February 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"online journal\">{{cite journal|last=Lea|first=Dale|title=Genetic and Genomic Healthcare: Ethical Issues of Importance to Nurses|journal=The Online Journal of Issues in Nursing|date=31 January 2008|volume=13|doi=10.3912/OJIN.Vol13No01Man04|url=http://nursingworld.org/MainMenuCategories/ANAMarketplace/ANAPeriodicals/OJIN/TableofContents/vol132008/No1Jan08/GeneticandGenomicHealthcare.html|accessdate=23 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Genetics]]\n[[Category:Nursing specialties]]", "Travel nursing": "{{globalize|date=December 2010}}\n'''Travel nursing''' is a nursing assignment concept that developed in response to the [[nursing shortage]]. This industry supplies [[nurses]] who travel to work in temporary nursing positions, mostly in hospitals. While travel nursing traditionally refers specifically to the nursing profession, it can also be used as a blanket term to refer to a variety of travel healthcare positions, including physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology, and even doctors and dentists.<ref>Travel Nurse Insights: Barry W. Padgett 1st Edition 2009 p.1</ref>\n\nReasons cited for pursuing travel nursing opportunities include higher pay, professional growth and development, and personal adventure. Travelers typically select from one or more recruitment agencies to act as intermediaries between the traveler and hospitals or other potential employers, but may also work as an Independent Contractor (IC). Agencies may submit applications for numerous positions concurrently on behalf of a traveler. No single agency has access to all travel opportunities.\n\n==Clinical requirements==\nThe usual requirements for becoming a travel nurse are a minimum of 1.5 years of clinical experience with 1 year being preferred in one's specialty and licensure in the state of employment, often granted through reciprocity with the home state's [[board of nursing]]. Some travel agencies will reimburse travelers for the cost of the license or other required certifications. A travel nurse may receive a minimal orientation to the new hospital (and rarely no orientation at all). Travel nurses are expected to be very experienced and knowledgeable in the given specialty.\n\nIf the nurse's home state has joined the [[Nurse Licensure Compact]] (NLCA), the nurse can work in any other compact state as long as the home state license is in good standing. This facilitates the license reciprocity process and potentially speeds up the time to employment. There are currently 23 states participating in NLCA; the state of Missouri is pending implementation.\n\n==Travel nursing assignment==\nTravelers typically work under a short-term contract.  In the United States, these contracts typically range from 4 to 13 weeks, although 26-week assignments are also possible, and some travel nurses will accept back-to-back assignments from the same facility. Contracts outside of the U.S. can last 1\u20132 years. Frequently, a permanent position is offered by the hospital at the end of the contract.\n\nThere are multiple areas of Travel Nursing. Basic Travel, Rapid Response, Strike and most recently EMR Conversions.\n\n==Compensation==\n\n===Pay===\nTravel nurses are paid by the travel nursing agency that placed them, which in turn is paid by the hospital. The amount of money a hospital pays to the agency is referred to as the ''bill rate''. The agency calculates and subtracts costs, overhead and profit margin from the bill rate and pays the difference to the traveler.  To compensate travelers, higher rates than the rates paid to permanent staff is the norm. Pay can range from $30\u201350/hour or more,<ref>[http://www.travelrnjobs.org/travel-nurse-salary-info Travel Nurse Salary Info] ''Travel RN Jobs'', 2012</ref> depending on various factors. Variables that affect pay include the location of the assignment (vacation destinations tend to be more competitive and therefore able to find willing applicants for less), demand for the position, local cost of living and the type of nursing specialty being sought.\n\nSince all costs and compensation must come out of the bill rate, a traveler working for an agency offering a high level of \"extras\" will probably be paid lower wages than one working for an agency that offers few or no non-wage perks.\n\n===Housing===\nIf travel agencies provide housing, it usually consists of a one-bedroom furnished apartment. Utilities (electric, water, trash) may be included. Telephone, cable television and sometimes Internet service can be included. Housing may include a washer and dryer, dishwasher, microwave and basic housewares such as pots, dishes, utensils and linens. Some travel companies allow the travel nurse to participate in the housing search and selection process.\n\nNearly all agencies will offer a housing stipend if the nurse chooses to secure housing independent of the agency. Stipend amounts can be substantial (even higher than actual wages) and these may be provided tax-free if the traveler has a qualifying tax home. Some companies require the traveler to take the housing stipend. The housing stipend or the value of the provided housing is taxed as part of the pay if the traveler does not have a qualifying tax home.\n\n===Assignment reimbursements===\nA travel allowance is generally paid by the travel agency. Some agencies offer healthcare insurance (or reimbursement for insurance held elsewhere), the ability to contribute to 401(k)accounts (sometimes with matching funds), licensure reimbursment, referral bonuses and loyalty reward programs. Some companies are even starting to add vacation and sick days, stock investment options and continuing education reimbursements.\n\n==Professional organization==\nThe [[Professional Association of Nurse Travelers]] is the non-profit national organization representing nurse travelers in the United States. Founded in 2007, the association is a 501(c)(6) non-profit organization.<ref>[http://www.pantravelers.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=14&Itemid=71 PanTravelers website: About Us]</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\nThere are an estimated 25,500 RNs working travel nursing jobs in the U.S. The number of LVN/LPN Nurse or Allied Healthcare Travelers is not known.<ref name=\"Stats2\">\n[http://www.pantravelers.org \"The Professional Association of Nurse Travelers\"] PanTravelers, 2007.</ref>\n\nPresently there are over 340 U.S. travel nurse companies (110 are Joint Commission Certified).

Critical care nurses can be found working in a wide variety of environments and specialties, such as  [[emergency department]]s and the [[intensive care]] units.\n\n== Specific Jobs and Personal Qualities ==\nCritical Care Nurses are also known as ICU nurses. They treat patients who are chronically ill or at risk for deadly illnesses.<ref>Villanova University. \"Nursing Careers: Critical Care Nurse.\" Critical Care Nursing. University Alliance, Bisk Education Inc., 2013. Web. 17 Nov. 2013.</ref> The main job of a Critical Care Nurse is to make sure all of their chronically ill or injured patients in their unit are provided with the care that they need to improve their mental state, physical state. These nurses make use of their specialized knowledge of the human anatomy to provide the best possible care they can for their patients. On a day to day basis a CCRN will commonly \"Perform assessments of critical conditions, Give intensive therapy and intervention, Advocate for their patients, Operate life support systems.\" <ref>\"Critical Care Nurse.\" DiscoverNursing.com. Johnson & Johnson Services, 3 Jan. 2013.

American Association of Critical Care Nurses, 2013. Web. 19 Nov. 2013.</ref>nursing is very good work\n\n== Training and education ==\nMost critical care nurses in the U.S. are [[registered nurses]].{{citation needed|date=July 2011}} Due to the unstable nature of the patient population the [[Licensed practical nurse|LPN/LVNs]] are rarely utilized in a primary care role in the intensive care unit. However, with proper training and experience LPN/LVNs can play a significant role in providing exceptional bedside care for the critically ill patient.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}} To become a Critical Care Nurse one must first achieve an Associate or Bachelors degree in Nursing and pass the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX-RN). Once the exam is passed, then someone can start working as a regular registered nurse (RN). The person must work for two years as an RN while continuing their education for their specialty area, critical care nursing for this situation. Once the requirements are met, the next step is to take the critical care nursing certification from the \u201cAmerican Association of Critical Care Nurses.\u201d <ref>Critical Care Nurse</ref> This advisory board sets and maintains standards for critical care nurses. The certification offered by this board is known as CCRN. This does not stand for 'Critical Care Registered Nurse' as is popularly believed, but is merely a ''certification'' as a critical care nurse for adult, pediatric and neonatal populations. Also, depending on the hospital and State the person will be required to take a certain amount of continuing education hours to stay up to date with the current technologies and changing techniques.<ref>Critical Care Nurse</ref>\n\n''Registration'' is a regulatory term for the process that occurs between the individual nurse and the state in which the nurse practices. All nurses in the US are registered as nurses without a specialty. The CCRN is an example of a post registration specialty certification in critical care.\n\nThere are also variants of critical care certification test that the AACN offers to allow nurses to certify in progressive care (PCCN), cardiac medicine (CMC) and cardiac surgery (CSC). In addition, [[Clinical Nurse Specialist]]s can certify in adult, neonatal and pediatric acute and critical care (CCNS). In November, 2007, the AACN Certification Corporation launched the ACNPC, an advanced practice certification examination for [[Acute Care Nurse Practitioner]]s .{{citation needed|date=July 2011}} None of these certifications confer any additional practice privileges, as nursing practice is regulated by the individual's state board of nursing. These certifications are not required to work in an intensive care unit, but are encouraged by employers, as the tests for these certifications tend to be difficult to pass and require an extensive knowledge of both pathophysiology and critical care medical and nursing practices. The certification, while difficult to obtain, is looked upon by many in the field as demonstrating expertise in the field of critical care nursing, and demonstrating the individual's nurse's desire to advance their knowledge base and skill set, thereby allowing them to better care for their patients.\n\nIntensive care nurses are also required to be comfortable with a wide variety \nof technology and its uses in the critical care setting. This technology includes such equipment as hemodynamic and cardiac monitoring systems, [[mechanical ventilator]] therapy, [[intra-aortic balloon pump]]s (IABP), [[ventricular assist device]]s (LVAD and RVAD), [[Continuous renal replacement therapy|continuous renal replacement]] equipment (CRRT/CVVHDF), [[extracorporeal membrane oxygenation]] circuits (ECMO) and many other advanced life support devices. The training for the use of this equipment is provided through a network of in-hospital inservices, manufacturer training, and many hours of education time with experienced operators. Annual continuing education is required by most states in the U.S. and by many employers to ensure that all skills are kept up to date. Many intensive care unit management teams will send their nurses to conferences to ensure that the staff is kept up to the current state of this rapidly changing technology.\n\n== Employment areas ==\nCritical care nurses work in a variety of different areas, with a diverse patient population. There are many critical care nurses working in hospitals in intensive care units, post-operative care and high dependency units. They also work on medical evacuation and transport teams.\n\nIn August 2004, to demonstrate the work of critical care nurses [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] invited reporter Scott Allen and photographer Michelle McDonald from [[The Boston Globe]] to take part in an 'immersion experience' in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU). ''The Globe'' staffers spent eight months shadowing an experienced [[nurse]] and a trainee nurse to learn about nursing practice first hand. The result was a four part, front-page series that ran from October 23\u2013-October 26, 2005, entitled ''Critical Care: The making of an ICU nurse''.<ref>{{Citation |last=Allen|first=Scott|author-link=| title=Critical Care: The Making of an ICU Nurse.|newspaper=The Boston Globe|publication-place=Boston, MA|date=October 23, 2005}}</ref>\n\nThe added psychological stress of nursing in critical care units has been well-documented, and it has been argued the stress experienced in ICU areas are unique in the profession.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hay, MD |first1=Donald |last2=Oken, MD |first2=Donald |year=March\u2013April 1972 |title=The Psychological Stresses of Intensive Care Unit Nursing |journal=Psychosomatic Medicine |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=109\u2013118 |publisher= |doi= |url=http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/content/34/2/109.full.pdf |accessdate=2012-02-22}}</ref>\n\n== Patient Interaction ==\nAccording to Washington, no matter their specialty, all nurses must be able to build trusting relationships with their patients. When the nurses develop strong relationships between their patients they are able to obtain important information about them that may be helpful to diagnosing them. Also, family members that become involved in this relationship make it easier for the nurses to build these trusting relationships with the patient\u2019s because the family members could ease any stress that could lead the patient to be timid. When a patient has a long-term illness, the good relationships built between the nurse and patient can improve the patient\u2019s quality of life.<ref>GT, Washington. \"Trust: A Critical Element in Critical Care Nursing.\" NCBI. U.S. National Library of Medicine, 1990. Web. 19 Nov. 2013.</ref>\n\n== Subspecialities ==\nCritical Care Nurses can specialize in several different areas based on either the patient\u2019s age or the illness/injury that the patient has. Geriatric patients are considered to be people over the age of 65 and nurses that specialize in geriatrics work in an adult Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Pediatric patients are children under the age of 18, a nurse that works with very sick children would work in a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). Finally, a child is considered a neonatal patient from the time they are born to when they leave the hospital. If a child is born with a life threatening illness the child would be transferred to a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU).<ref>Critical Care Nurse</ref>\n\nAlso, the location that the CCRN works can vary. Some places that they can work most commonly include hospitals: in regular or specialized intensive care units. Uncommonly they can work at some patients\u2019 homes, in some flight centers and outpatient facilities.<ref>Critical Care Nurse</ref> \n    \nThe specialty areas of the Critical Care Nurses can also be based on the patient\u2019s illness or injury. For example, a unit that is an Adult Intensive care unit, specialized in the care of trauma patients would be an Adult Trauma Intensive Care Unit. The focus of the unit is generally on either an adult or a pediatric/neonatal population, as the treatment methods differ for the age ranges. Another example could include an Intensive Care Unit solely to care for patients directly before and after a major or minor surgery.<ref>Villanova University</ref>\n\n== Salary ==\nCritical Care Nurses are specialty nurses, because of this, they require more in depth and specialized training than regular RNs do. Therefore their salaries are usually higher compared to basic RN\u2019s because of the more intense work that they do day to day. The national average salary for a CCRN is around $69,110. However, in the top percentile salaries can reach $96,630, and on the low end of the spectrum it can be $44,970.<ref>Parker, Mike. \"The Salary of a CCRN.\" Work. Hearst Communications, n.d.

The term ''neonatal'' comes from ''neo'', \"new\", and ''natal'', \"pertaining to birth or origin\".<ref name=\"etym\"/>  Neonatal nurses are a vital part of the neonatal care team.<ref name=\"century\"/>\n\n==Levels==\nThere are three different levels of neonatal [[Nursery (room)|nursery]] where a neonatal nurse might work.<ref name=\"nursesource\"/> The updated classification of neonatal levels by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) includes a Level IV.\n* '''Level I''' consists of caring for healthy newborns.  Level I nurseries are now uncommon in the United States. Healthy babies typically share a room with their mother, and both patients are usually discharged from the hospital quickly.<ref name=\"selga\"/>\n* '''Level II''' provides intermediate or special care for [[premature birth|premature]] or ill newborns.  At this level, infants may need special therapy provided by nursing staff, or may simply need more time before being discharged.\n* '''Level III''', the [[Neonatal intensive-care unit]] (NICU), treats newborns who cannot be treated in the other levels and are in need of high technology to survive, such as breathing and feeding tubes. Nurses comprise over 90 percent of the NICU staff.<ref name=\"century\"/>\n\n==Changes in Neonatal Care==\nNeonatal Care became a specialty in the United States in 1960 and that is the same year that the first NICU was established in the United States. \nThere have been some major changes in the Neonatal Care over the past 120 years.\nSome of these changes include the invention of the incubator, changes in respiratory care, and the development of surfactants.\n\nThe Incubator\n*In 1880, Dr. Tarnier was convinced that the maintenance of internal temperature was key to the premature infant's survival. This led him to introduce the first human incubator. He saw an incubator in use for hatching chickens by a zookeeper, and asked the zoo keeper to design a similar incubator for premature infants. \n*Dr. Delee expanded the use and function of the incubator by incorporating an oxygen chamber and an electric controlled thermostat which allowed the incubator to be transported in ambulances.\n\nRespiratory Care\n*The survival rate of neonates has greatly improved since the discovery of oxygen use in preterm infants. \n*Oxygen administration began with a metal forked device in the nostrils, it is now administered through thin plastic tubes in the nostrils\n*The first ventilation of an infant was in 1961 in a positive pressure situation, and mechanical ventilation was improved in 1971.\n*CPAP masks were first used in 1973 as an alternate less invasive form of support. \n\nSurfactants\n*In 1980, the first study of the use of surfactants on infants took place in Japan. \n*Surfactant therapy since has improved the infant morality rate by 50%.\n*Surfactants combined with the least invasive respiratory therapy (bubble CPAP or nasal CPAP) has greatly improved the infant mortality rate in the US.\n\n\n\n== Qualifications and requirements ==\nHealthcare institutions have varying entry-level requirements for neonatal nurses. Neonatal nurses are [[Registered Nurse]]s (RNs), and therefore must have an [[Associate of Science in Nursing]] (ASN) or [[Bachelor of Science in Nursing]] (BSN) degree.<!-- diploma nurses can also be RNs --> Some countries or institutions may also require a [[midwifery]] qualification.<ref name=\"coinn\"/>  Some institutions may accept newly graduated RNs who have passed the [[NCLEX]] exam; others may require additional experience working in adult-health or medical/surgical nursing.<ref name=\"nursesource\"/>\n\nSome countries offer postgraduate degrees in neonatal nursing, such as the [[Master of Science in Nursing]] (MSN) and various [[Doctorate in Nursing|doctorates]].  A [[nurse practitioner]] may be required to hold a postgraduate degree.<ref name=\"coinn\"/>  The National Association of Neonatal Nurses recommends two years' experience working in a NICU before taking graduate classes.<ref name=\"nursesource\"/>\n\nAs with any registered nurse, local licensing or certifying bodies as well as employers may set requirements for continuing education.<ref name=\"nursesource\"/>\n\nThere are no mandated requirements to becoming an RN in a NICU, although neonatal nurses must complete the [[Neonatal Resuscitation Program]].  Some units prefer new graduates who do not have experience in other units, so they may be trained in the specialty exclusively, while others prefer nurses with more experience.\n\nIntensive care nurses receive intensive [[didactic]] and clinical orientation, in addition to their general nursing knowledge, to provide highly specialized care for critical patients.  Their competencies include the administration of high-risk medications, management of high-acuity patients requiring ventilator support, surgical care, resuscitation, advanced interventions such as [[extracorporeal membrane oxygenation]] or [[hypothermia therapy for neonatal encephalopathy]] procedures, as well as chronic-care management or lower acuity cares associated with premature infants such as feeding intolerance, [[phototherapy]], or administering antibiotics. NICU RNs undergo annual skills tests and are subject to additional training to maintain contemporary practice.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|1=2|refs=\n\t<ref name=\"etym\">{{cite web\n\t  | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=neonatal\n\t  | title = neonatal\n\t  | work = Online Etymology Dictionary\n\t  | last = Harper\n\t  | first = Douglas\n\t  | publisher = Douglas Harper\n\t  | accessdate = October 26, 2010\n\t}}</ref>\n\t<ref name=\"nursesource\">{{cite web\n\t  | url = http://www.nursesource.org/neonatal.html\n\t  | title = Neonatal Nurse\n\t  | work = Nurses for a Healthier Tomorrow\n\t  | publisher = Nurses for a Healthier Tomorrow\n\t  | accessdate = October 26, 2010\n\t}}</ref>\n\t<ref name=\"coinn\">{{cite web\n\t  | url = http://www.coinnurses.org/faqs.htm\n\t  | title = Frequently Asked Questions\n\t  | work = Global Unity for Neonatal Nurses\n\t  | publisher = Council of International Neonatal Nurses\n\t  | location = Boston\n\t  | year = 2009\n\t  | accessdate = October 26, 2010\n\t}}</ref>\n\t<ref name=\"selga\">{{cite web\n\t  | url = http://www.doh.gov.ph/itrmc/hospital_length_of_stay.htm\n\t  | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070423125720/http://www.doh.gov.ph/itrmc/hospital_length_of_stay.htm\n\t  | title = Hospital Length of Stay and Readmission Rates for Normal Deliveries: a controlled evaluation\n\t  | last = Selga\n\t  | first = Anna May A.\n\t  | archivedate = April 23, 2007\n\t  | accessdate = October 26, 2010\n\t  | work = Ilocos Training and Regional Medical Center\n\t  | publisher = Department of Health, Republic of the Philippines\n\t  | location = Manila\n\t}}</ref>\n\t<ref name=\"century\">{{cite journal\n\t  | title = Conference summary: a celebration of a century of neonatal care\n\t  | journal = Proceedings\n\t  | publisher = Baylor University Medical Center\n\t  | location = Dallas\n\t  | date = July 2004\n\t  | volume = 17\n\t  | pmid = 16200108\n\t  | issue = 3\n\t  | pages = 255\u2013258\n\t  | pmc = 1200660\n\t  | last = Whitfield\n\t  | first = Jonathan M.\n\t  | last2 = Peters\n\t  | first2 = Beverly A.\n\t  | last3 = Shoemaker\n\t  | first3 = Craig\n\t  | accessdate = August 26, 2010\n\t}}</ref>\n          <ref name=\"AAP\">{{cite web\n\t  | url =  http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/130/3/587.full.html\n\t  | title = Levels of Neonatal Care\n\t  | work = Committee on Fetus and Newborn\n\t  | publisher = American Academy of Pediatrics\n\t  | year = 2012\n\t  | accessdate = June 5, 2013\n          }}</ref>\n}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Nursing}}\n*[http://www.awhonn.org/awhonn/ Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses]\n*[http://www.academyonline.org/ The Academy of Neonatal Nursing]\n*[http://thepediatriccare.com/Main_Pages/1/1/1/k/0/Pre_Conception.html/ Pre Conception& Neonatal]\n\n{{Nursing}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Neonatal Nursing}}\n[[Category:Nursing specialties]]\n[[Category:Neonatology]]", "Cardiac catheter laboratory nursing": "#REDIRECT[[cardiac catheterization]]", "Nursing informatics": "#REDIRECT [[Health informatics]]", "Space nursing": "[[File:John Glenn confers with Nurse Dolores B.
