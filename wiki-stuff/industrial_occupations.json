Milling existed in [[hunter-gatherer]] communities, and later millers were important to the [[history of agriculture|development of agriculture]].\n\nThe materials ground by millers are often [[foodstuff]]s and particularly [[cereal|grain]].  The physical grinding of the food allows for the easier digestion of its [[nutrient]]s and saves wear on the teeth. Non-food substances needed in a fine, powdered form, such as [[building materials]], may be processed by a miller.\n\n[[Image:Bedandrind.jpg|A Bedstone & the Rind.|Px150|left|thumb|A bedstone and rind. [[Dalgarven Mill]], Scotland.]]\nThe most basic tool for a miller was the [[quern-stone]]\u2014simply a large, fixed stone as a base and another movable stone operated by hand, similar to a [[mortar and pestle]].  As technology and [[millstones]] (the [[bedstone]] and [[Millrind|rynd]]) improved, more elaborate machines such as [[watermill]]s and [[windmill]]s were developed to do the grinding work. These mills harnessed available energy sources including animal, water, wind, and electrical power.  Mills are some of [[mill (factory)|the oldest factories]] in human history, so factories making other items are sometimes known as mills, for example, [[cotton mill]]s and [[steel mill]]s.  These factory workers are also called millers.\n\nThe rynd in [[history of Scotland|pre-reformation Scotland]] was often carved on millers' gravestones as a symbol of their trade.\n\nIn a traditional [[rural]] society, a miller is often wealthier than ordinary peasants, which can lead to jealousy and to millers being targeted in [[bread riots]] at times of [[famine]]. Conversely, millers might be in a stronger position vis-a-vis [[feudal]] land owners than are ordinary peasants.\n\n[[Image:Monselice z21.JPG|thumb|right|A man dressed as a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] miller at a festival in [[Monselice]].]]\nThe traditional carnival held annually in the city of [[Ivrea#Culture|Ivrea]], [[Italy]] commemorates a spirited \"Mugnaia\" (miller's daughter) who supposedly  refused to let a local duke exercise his [[right of the first night]], and proceeded to chop the duke's head off and spark a revolution.

The word is the combination of \"wheel\" and the archaic word \"[[wright]]\", which comes from the [[Old English]] word \"''wryhta''\", meaning a worker or maker.<ref>{{cite book |title=Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary |isbn=0-87779-338-7}}</ref> This occupational name eventually became the English [[surname]] ''Wheelwright''.\n\nThese tradesmen made wheels for [[carts]] and [[wagons]] by first constructing the hub (called the nave), the [[spokes]] and the rim/felloe segments (pronounced fellies) and assembling them all into a unit working from the center of the wheel outwards. Most wheels were made from [[wood]], but other materials have been used, such as [[bone]] and [[horn (anatomy)|horn]], for decorative or other purposes.  Some earlier construction for wheels such as those used in early chariots were bound by rawhide that would be applied wet and would shrink whilst drying, compressing and binding the woodwork together. After many centuries wheels evolved to be straked with iron, a method of nailing iron plates onto the felloes to protect against wear on the ground and to help bind the wheel together. Around the middle of the 19th century, iron strakes were replaced by a solid [[iron]] tyre custom made by a [[blacksmith]], who first measured each wheel to ensure proper fit.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Strakes were replaced around the mid-19th century by more dependable iron tyres that were always made smaller than the wheel in circumference, expanded by heating in a fire then placed on the wooden wheel and quenched quickly with water to shrink it onto the wood, then fastened to the wooden wheel by nails or tyre bolts.  Tyre-bolts were less likely than tyre-nails to break off because they were flush finished and countersunk into the wheel's outer surface also allowing for wear without wearing the bolt head away. {{citation needed|date=October 2012}} During the second half of the 19th century, the use of pre-manufactured iron hubs, and other factory-made wood, iron and rubber wheel parts became increasingly common. Companies such as Henry Ford developed manufacturing processes that soon made the village wheelwright obsolete, added to the onset of two world wars the trade soon went into decline and was very rare by the 1960s almost extinct by the year 2000. However, owing to the efforts of organisations like the Worshipful Company of Wheelwrights, wheelwrights still continue to operate in the UK.

The word ''wheelwright'' remains a term usually used for someone who makes and repairs wheels for horse-drawn vehicles, although it is sometimes used to refer to someone who repairs wheels, wheel alignment, rims, [[drum brake|drums]], [[disc brake|discs]] and wire [[spoke]]s on modern vehicles such as [[automobile]]s, [[bus]]es and [[truck]]s.  Wheels for [[horse-drawn vehicles]] continue to be constructed and repaired for use by people who use such vehicles for [[farming]], competitions, and presentations of historical events such as [[reenactment]]s and [[living history]].\n\n* [[Wheelbuilding]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*{{cite book\n  | last = Hendrikson\n  | first = M.C.\n  | authorlink = \n  | coauthors = \n  | title = The Secrets of Wheelwrighting: Tyres\n  | publisher = M.C. and P.

In repairing cars, their main role is to diagnose the problem accurately and quickly. They often have to quote prices for their customers before commencing work or after partial dis-assembly for inspection. Their job may involve the repair of a specific part or the replacement of one or more parts as assemblies.\n\nBasic vehicle maintenance is a fundamental part of a mechanic's work in modern industrialized countries, while in others they are only consulted when a vehicle is already showing signs of malfunction. Preventative maintenance is also a fundamental part of a mechanic's job, but this is not possible in the case of vehicles that are not regularly maintained by a mechanic. One misunderstood aspect of preventative maintenance is ''scheduled replacement'' of various parts, which occurs before failure to avoid far more expensive damage.  Because this means that parts are replaced before any problem is observed, many vehicle owners will not understand why the expense is necessary.\n\nWith the rapid advancement in technology, the mechanic's job has evolved from purely mechanical, to include electronic technology.  Because vehicles today possess complex computer and electronic systems, mechanics need to have a broader base of knowledge than in the past.\n\nDue to the increasingly labyrinthine nature of the technology that is now incorporated into automobiles, most automobile dealerships and independent workshops now provide sophisticated diagnostic computers to each technician, without which they would be unable to diagnose or repair a vehicle.\n\n==Education==\n\n===USA===\nIn the [[United States]], several programs and schools (such as UTI and UNOH) that offer training for those interested in pursuing competencies as an automotive mechanic or as an auto technician already exist.  Areas include [[powertrain]] repair and diagnosis, emissions, and suspension. The National Automotive Tech Education Foundation (NATEF) is responsible for evaluating technician training programs against standards developed by the automotive industry. NATEF certifies programs in four different categories: automotive, auto body, trucks (diesel technology) and alternative fuels.\n\nSome mechanics are [[Automotive Service Excellence|ASE]] certified, which is a standardized method of testing skill and knowledge level. While it's not required by law for a mechanic to be certified, some companies only hire or promote employees who have passed ASE tests. The technology used in automobiles changes very rapidly and the mechanic must be prepared to learn these new technologies and systems.  The auto mechanic has a physically demanding job, often exposed to extreme temperatures, lifting heavy objects and staying in uncomfortable positions for extended periods. They also deal with exposure to gasoline, asbestos, and other toxic chemicals.\n\nThe Internet is even spreading to mechanics, with certified mechanics providing advice online. Mechanics themselves now regularly use the Internet for information to help them in diagnosing and/or repairing vehicles.  Service manuals for vehicles have become significantly less prevalent with computers that are connected to the Internet taking their position.\n\n==Related careers==\nA mechanic usually works from the workshop in which the (well equipped) mechanic has access to a vehicle lift to access areas that are difficult to reach when the car is on the ground. Beside the workshop bound mechanic, there are mobile mechanics like those of the UK Automobile Association (the AA)<ref>[http://www.theaa.com/about www.theaa.com/about] The AA. Retrieved 28 November 2013.{{Dead link|date=November 2013}}</ref> which allow the car owner to receive assistance without the car necessarily having to be brought to a garage.\n\nA mechanic may opt to engage in other careers related to his or her field.  Teaching of automotive trade courses, for example, is almost entirely carried out by qualified mechanics in many countries.\n\nThere are several other trade qualifications for working on motor vehicles, including ''[[panel beater]]'', ''spray painter'', ''body builder'' and ''motorcycle mechanic''.  In most developed countries, these are separate trade courses, but a qualified trades-person from one can change to working as another.  This usually requires that they work under another trades-person in much the same way as an apprentice.\n\nAuto body repair involves less work with oily and greasy parts of vehicles, but involves exposure to particulate dust from sanding bodywork and potentially toxic chemical fumes from paint and related products.  Salespeople and dealers often also need to acquire an in-depth knowledge of cars, and some mechanics are successful in these roles because of their knowledge. Auto mechanics also need to stay updated with all the leading car companies as well as new launching cars. One has to study continuously on new technology engines and their work systems.\n\n===Pit crews===\nPit crews for motor racing are a specialized form of work undertaken by some mechanics.  It is sometimes portrayed as glamorous in movies and television and is considered prestigious in some parts of the automotive industry.  Working in a pit crew in professional racing circuits is dangerous and very stressful work but usually pays highly.  This work is sometimes perceived as being difficult to come by because of the skill levels required.\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikibooks|Automobile Repair}}\n{{Commons category|Automobile repair}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Automobile maintenance]]\n[[Category:Industrial occupations]]", "Stationary engineer": "{{Redirect-distinguish2|Power engineer|a professional engineer who specializes in [[power engineering]]}}\n\nA '''stationary engineer''', also called '''operating engineer''' or '''power engineer''', is a [[professional]] who operates heavy machinery and equipment that provide heat, light, climate control and power. Stationary engineers are trained in many areas, including mechanical, thermal, chemical, electrical, metallurgical, computer, and a wide range of safety skills. They typically work in [[Factory|factories]], offices, [[hospital]]s, [[warehouse]]s, power generation plants, industrial facilities, and residential and commercial buildings.  Stationary engineering is not within the scope of  [[Professional Engineering]].\n\nStationary engineers are responsible for the safe operation and maintenance of a wide range of equipment, including pumps, gas compressors, generators, motors, boilers, [[gas turbine]]s, steam turbines, air conditioning systems, heat exchangers and refrigeration equipment, [[heat recovery steam generator]]s (HRSGs) that may be directly (duct burners) or indirectly fired (gas turbine exhaust collectors), hot water generators, [[steam turbine]]s, and [[refrigeration]] machinery in addition to its associated auxiliary equipment ([[air compressor]]s, [[Gas compressor|natural gas compressors]], [[electrical]] [[switchgear]], [[pump]]s, etc.). Power electricians construct, maintain and commission electrical apparatus used in electrical power generation, transmission, distribution and converter systems. They install, maintain and repair power generators, power converters, power transformers, circuit breakers, distribution apparatus, and metering and associated auxiliary equipment.\n\nStationary engineers may hold various titles, such as boiler operator, [[power plant]] operator, or watch engineer. In addition, some may have various designations, such as first class, second class and third class. In the [[United States]], stationary engineers must be [[license]]d in several cities and [[U.S. state|states]]. The [[New York City Department of Buildings]] requires a Stationary Engineer's License to practice in the [[New York City|City of New York]]; to obtain the license one must pass a written and practical exam and have at least five years' experience working directly under a licensed stationary engineer, or three years if in possession of a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[mechanical engineering]]. Holders of the Stationary Engineer's License primarily work in large [[power generation]] facilities, such as [[cogeneration]] power plants, peaking units, and large [[central heating]] and refrigeration plants (CHRPs).\n\nThe stationary engineering [[trade]] emerged during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The group includes [[railroad engineer]]s and [[marine engineer]]s. Famous people who began their working lives in this trade include [[George Stephenson]] and [[Henry Ford]]. The early [[steam engine]]s developed by [[Thomas Savery]] and [[Thomas Newcomen]] which drew water from mines and the industrial steam engines perfected by [[James Watt]] and others employed the ancestors of today's engineers. Railroad engineers operated early steam [[locomotive]]s and continue to operate trains today. The traditions and classification of the engineer were developed to the greatest extent by marine engineers who worked in the [[engine department|engine rooms]] of the great [[ocean liner]]s in the 19th and 20th century. The use of the title \"engineer\" by stationary engineers has been challenged in court by [[university]]-educated [[professional engineer]]s; however, the stationary engineers have prevailed to date. The job of today's engineer has been greatly changed by computers and automation as well as the replacement of steam engines on ships and trains. Workers have adapted to the challenges of the changing job market. \n\nMany stationary engineers are becoming more involved with the technical aspect of the job as it has shifted toward a dependence on building automation. Building and central plant operations are now relying heavily on direct digital controls; and as such the engineer is required to be much more computer literate to work with the BAS (Building Automation System).\n\nStationary engineers may also choose to be unionized; many larger cities are very reliant on the services of organized employees. Non-union buildings may blend their engineers with general maintenance staff, and as such may be required to also provide general building services such as cleaning or other non-skilled duties. There are two main types of workers sharing the title and trade union affiliation ([[International Union of Operating Engineers]]). The first group are workers who operate [[Thermal power station|steam plants]] or [[boiler]]s. These are generally called stationary engineers but are known by other titles such as boiler operators, thermal technicians and power engineers. The second group is a larger class who drive and operate [[crane (machine)|cranes]] and [[engineering vehicle]]s such as  [[bulldozer]]s and [[grader]]s used in [[construction]] and [[engineering]] projects.\n\n==References==\n{{refimprove|date=September 2010}}\n\n==External links==\n*The International Union of Operating Engineers\n* [http://www.powerengineers.com/about%20us/history.html The National Association of Power Engineers, history of \"Stationary Engineers\"]\n*[http://www.asope.org The American Society of Power Engineers]\n*[http://www.niulpe.org The National Institute for the Uniform Licensing of Power Engineers]\n\n[[Category:Industrial occupations]]", "Filling station attendant": "{{globalize/North America|date=December 2013}}\nA '''filling station attendant''', '''gas station attendant''' (United States and Canada), or '''gas jockey''' (US), is a worker at a full-service [[filling station]] who performs services other than accepting payment.

Prior to the introduction of [[Starter (engine)|self-starting]] vehicle engines, attendants would also start vehicle engines by manually turning the [[crankshaft]] with a hand [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]].\n\nIn the United States, gas jockeys were often [[gratuity|tipped]] for their services,<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Gasoline|url=http://www.chevroncars.com/learn/cars/history-of-gasoline|publisher=chevroncars.com}}</ref> but this is now rare as full-service stations are uncommon except in New Jersey and Oregon where retail customers are prohibited by law from pumping their own gasoline (self-serve gas stations are banned).\n\n==History==\n{{See|Filling station#History of filling stations}}\nEarly filling stations were usually located at [[general store]]s, where [[gasoline]] would be put in buckets and [[funnel]]ed into vehicles.

In these states, attendants are required to pump gasoline because customers are barred by statutes from doing it themselves. New Jersey banned self-service gasoline in 1949 after lobbying by service station owners. Oregon banned self-service gasoline in 1951. Proponents of the ban cite safety and jobs as reasons to keep the ban.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Fuel dispenser]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gas Jockey}}\n[[Category:Industrial occupations]]", "Patternmaker": "{{multiple issues|\n{{unreferenced|date=November 2013}}\n{{Underlinked|date=March 2014}}\n}}\n\nApparel '''patternmaker'''s draft patterns based on a designer's sketch of a style. The designer gives the sketch to the '''patternmaker''', who can ask questions to determine details the designer is looking for.\n\nPatterns may be drafted on paper or in a computer program designed for patternmaking. Most of the time, in modern American samplerooms, the patternmaker pulls an existing pattern (or block) and makes a modified copy of it to match the new style, either on paper or on computer. If it's a completely new style, the patternmaker will usually drape a rough draft in muslin fabric on a dress form, then show it to the designer to discuss any changes before transferring the markings to paper to create the pattern for cutting. Patterns may also be drafted from measurements, but this method has fallen out of use, as it's less accurate and takes longer than the other methods. Patternmakers are also asked to copy existing garments without damaging them. This is a common practice in American samplerooms.\n\nPatternmakers have a combination of engineering and design skill. They need to be able to understand what the designer wants, almost better than the designer, and know how to translate that into the lines of a pattern that will cause the garment to fit correctly. This ability to interpret the designer's ideal fit and flair is what sets great patternmakers apart from the masses and enables them to command high salaries. Being detail-oriented, style-conscious, perfectionist, and hard-working enable patternmakers to earn upwards of $100,000/year in New York or Los Angeles as of 2013. Freelance patternmakers can earn up to $40/hr or more in Los Angeles. Patternmaking services usually charge more than this, however.The time it takes to make any type of pattern is extremely difficult to predict, and few predictions are accurate.\n\nPatternmaking is taught in conjunction with fashion design education, as it is vital for designers to fully comprehend the apparel development process. It is also taught as a major at certain trade schools. There are many books on the subject, but it is rare for a patternmaker to become a professional through teaching oneself. Apprenticeships are almost unheard of in modern America, but would serve well to improve the transition from student to professional status. Because this occupation is relatively unknown outside of the apparel industry, there is a serious lack of patternmakers who can accurately interpret designs in Los Angeles, and possibly other fashion capitals.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Pattern (sewing)]]\n\n[[Category:Design]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]", "Mechanic": "{{Other uses}}\n{{Unreferenced|date=January 2012}}\n{{wiktionary}}\n[[File:Lewis Hine Power house mechanic working on steam pump.jpg|thumb|upright|Mechanic at [[steam pump]] in an [[Power station|electric power house]], 1920, (from a photo study for the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]]).]]\nA '''mechanic''' is a [[tradesman]], [[Artisan|craftsman]], or [[technician]] who uses tools to build or [[Home repair|repair]] [[Machine (mechanical)|machinery]].\n\n==Duties==\nMany mechanics are specialized in a particular field such as [[auto mechanic]]s, [[bicycle mechanic]]s, [[motorcycle]] mechanics, [[boiler]] mechanics, general mechanics, industrial maintenance mechanics ([[millwright]]s), [[air conditioning]] and [[refrigeration]] mechanics, [[Aircraft maintenance technician|aircraft mechanics]], [[Diesel engine|diesel mechanics]], and [[tank]] mechanics in the [[Military branch|armed services]].

A saw filer's work area in the mill is called the '''filing room'''.\n\nSaws used in timber mills are very large and expensive. They need careful [[Maintenance, repair, and operations|maintenance]] for safe operation. Repair of damaged saws requires a high degree of skill. It takes many years of full-time saw filing to become proficient in the trade.\n\n== Bandsaw filing ==\n{{Unreferenced|section|date=March 2014}}\n[[Bandsaw]]s in timber mills range in size from about (4\" x 22ga x 10') to (16\" x 11ga x 62') and can use any of the three main different saw band types: \n*Single-cut saws have, as the name implies, teeth on one side, allowing for cutting in one direction only.\n*Double-cut saws have teeth on both sides. These types are designed for machinery that allows the log or work piece to be cut from either the front or the back direction of travel. \n*\"Sliver tooth\" saws have teeth on both sides but they have different profiles. The (usual) front side have teeth with a regular style tooth. The back of these saws have a longer style. The log is cut in a forward direction as with a single-cut but as the log returns, the saw de-burrs the ''cut'' (path where the saw passes) allowing for a cleaner finish. They are run for 4 to 24 hours then sent to the saw filer for maintenance.\n\nThe saw filer inspects the saw for needed repairs then gums, fits and benches the saw as necessary. \n\n'''Gumming''' involves grinding the gullets of the saw teeth to a particular shape. The saw filer uses a semi or fully automatic [[grinding machine]] for this. Saw bands operate under high stress and heat and in the presence of wood chips. Carbon migrates into the steel from the wood. Gumming prevents [[case hardening]] and fatigue cracking of the saw band gullets. Resaw Bandsaws (teeth on one side only) may be left or right-handed, depending on which way the teeth are pointing and which way the plank falls from the log when cutting. Double cut saws (teeth on both sides) are always gummed right hand teeth first.\n\nA precise profile of the tooth (including gullet area, hook angle and top clearance angle) must be maintained for proper saw operation and wood chip removal. Ease of cutting greatly depends on this. The shape is determined by the type of wood and cutting conditions. A saw filer will maintain the gullet shape by manually shaping the grinding wheel with a dressing stone, and the set up of his grinding machine. Variations include face angle, face length, back angle, gullet width and depth, and a frost notch (if necessary). Typical bandsaw tooth dimensions are 1-3/4\" tooth space x 3/4\" gullet depth x 3/4\" gullet width (grinding wheel width) x 30deg face angle x 16deg back angle.\n\n'''Fitting''' means tooth dressing and involves swaging, shaping, gauging, and grinding. The tip of the saw tooth is [[swaging|swaged]] to a flare, then the sides are compressed in slightly with a shaper tool to an exact [[wikt:kerf|kerf]].  Then a final grinding pass is made.  The usual gauged tolerance is +/- .005\" in kerf, and < .003\" side to side variation. The same grinding machinery used for gumming is used for fitting.\n\nThe saw kerf is usually made this way from the base saw metal. Sometimes, however, the kerf is made with [[stellite]] or [[Tungsten carbide|carbide]] tips, in which case swaging and shaping isn't needed, although gumming is still required.  The kerf may also be 'set' with a punch and hammer, with the teeth bent left, right, left... Set teeth are rarely used.\n\n'''Benching''' is the leveling and tensioning of the saw.  When a saw band is run on a mill it is stretched with thousands of pounds of force, and during operation the cutting edge heats up.  These forces and temperatures cause the saw to deform. Benching deforms an un-mounted saw in a way that counteracts the operating stresses, and allows the saw to pull flat and cut straight when in use.  It takes months to learn benching.\n\nBenching is done in a dark room with a stretcher-roller machine and flat anvil. A single light at the benchman\u2019s work station, along with ground gauges, allows the saw filer to measure level and tension. \n\nLeveling is done with a crossface hammer and stretcher-roller adjustments. Cross face hammers are available in left and right hand versions.  Each filer has his own hammer which he carefully dresses.\n\nTensioning is done with the stretcher-roll. This machine has hardened rollers above and below the saw. They rotate slowly (one is powered, while on runs free) and pinch the saw when a lever is cranked, rolling a thin strip through the length of the saw, stretching the metal where it was rolled. Careful placement and force of the rolls deform the metal in a way that counteracts the forces the saw sees during operation. More rolls are placed in the midsection of the saw. Resaws have the back pulled to counteract the uneven heating of the cutting edge. This is done by rolling the back (non cutting edge) of the saw. The back is measured with a three pin gauge, and is usually around .003\" per three feet curved. \n\nBenching involves the simultaneous solution of multiple deformations introduced to the saw to counteract the predicted stresses of the saw in operation. Benchman can easily recognize variations in steel batches.\n\nOther bandsaw duties include [[welding]] broken teeth, fixing cracks, and [[trouble shooting]] operating problems.\n\n[[CNC]] equipment has evolved to the point of being able to do significant benching and fitting tasks.\n\nMost of the above terms are North American and are called different things in Australia New Zealand as well as else where in the world. \nA Sawdoctor does both the tasks of the Benchman and Filler at the same time, with no distinction between the tasks as well as having to do both circular saws and bandsaws.\nThis like filing rooms are called Saw Shops in Australia, Most Saw Mills in Australia and New Zealand run a stellite tiped bandsaw in which the majority of what is stated above becomes redundant as it is specifically for sharpening and making the swaged tipped saws.\n\n==Circular saw benching==<!-- This section is linked from [[Circular saw]] -->\nSaw filers have the same maintenance duties with circular saws as they do with band saws, with a few exceptions;\n*leveling is done mostly with specallized hammers of which there are 3 main types Dog head(side on profile resembles a dogs snout), twist face (A double sided hammer in which the faces are in a 45 degree alignment) and cross face ( faces are at 90 degrees to one another) and anvils (there are 2 main type of anvils dead (for levelling the saw) and live(for both leveling and tensioning the saw), although stretcher-roller machines are also used for leveling and tensioning.  \n*Circular saws can be solid tooth(straight saw steel which are bent to give clearance of the saw blade) or can have carbide, Stellite or insert  teeth that don't need swaging.\n*Fatigue cracking of the tooth gullet is not as common as in band saws, as in the majority of cases it is a heavier plate gauge and is not bent around band wheels multiple thousands of times per run.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Bandsaw]]\n*[[Circular saw]]\n*[[Saw mill]]\n*[[Saw]]\n*[[Portable sawmill]]\n\n==External links==\n\n[[Category:Industrial occupations]]\n[[Category:Saws]]\n[[Category:Metalworking occupations]]", "Maintenance engineering": "'''Maintenance Engineering''' is the discipline and profession of applying [[engineering]] concepts to the optimization of equipment, procedures, and departmental budgets to achieve better [[maintainability]], [[Reliability engineering|reliability]], and availability of equipment.\n\nMaintenance, and hence maintenance engineering, is increasing in importance due to rising amounts of equipment, systems, machineries and infrastructure.
