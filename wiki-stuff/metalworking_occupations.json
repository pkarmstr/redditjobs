Statistics itself also provides tools for prediction and forecasting the use of data through [[statistical model]]s. Statistics is applicable to a wide variety of [[academic discipline]]s, including [[natural]] and [[social science]]s, government, and business. [[Statistical consultant]]s can help organizations and companies that don't have in-house expertise relevant to their particular questions.\n\nStatistical methods can summarize or describe a collection of data. This is called ''[[descriptive statistics]]''. This is particularly useful in communicating the results of experiments and research. In addition, data patterns may be [[mathematical model|modeled]] in a way that accounts for [[randomness]] and uncertainty in the observations.\n\nThese models can be used to draw inferences about the process or population under study\u2014a practice called ''[[inferential statistics]]''. Inference is a vital element of scientific advance, since it provides a way to draw conclusions from data that are subject to random variation. To prove the propositions being investigated further, the conclusions are tested as well, as part of the [[scientific method]]. Descriptive statistics and analysis of the new data tend to provide more information as to the truth of the proposition.\n\n\"Applied statistics\" comprises descriptive statistics and the application of inferential statistics.<ref>Anderson, D.R.; Sweeney, D.J.; Williams, T.A..

Mathematical statistics includes not only the manipulation of [[probability distribution]]s necessary for deriving results related to methods of estimation and inference, but also various aspects of [[computational statistics]] and the [[design of experiments]].\n\nStatistics is closely related to [[probability theory]], with which it is often grouped. The difference is, roughly, that probability theory starts from the given parameters of a total population to [[deductive reasoning|deduce]] probabilities that pertain to samples. Statistical inference, however, moves in the opposite direction\u2014[[inductive reasoning|inductively inferring]] from samples to the parameters of a larger or total population. Statistics has many ties to [[machine learning]] and [[data mining]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of statistics|Founders of statistics}}\n\nStatistical methods date back at least to the 5th century BC.\n\nSome scholars pinpoint the origin of statistics to 1663, with the publication of ''Natural and Political Observations upon the Bills of Mortality'' by [[John Graunt]].<ref>Willcox, Walter (1938) \"The Founder of Statistics\". ''Review of the [[International Statistical Institute]]'' 5(4):321\u2013328. {{jstor|1400906}}</ref> Early applications of statistical thinking revolved around the needs of states to base policy on demographic and economic data, hence its [[History of statistics#Etymology|''stat-'' etymology]]. The scope of the discipline of statistics broadened in the early 19th century to include the collection and analysis of data in general. Today, statistics is widely employed in government, business, and natural and social sciences.\n\nIts mathematical foundations were laid in the 17th century with the development of the [[probability theory]] by [[Blaise Pascal]] and [[Pierre de Fermat]]. Mathematical [[probability theory]] arose from the study of games of chance, although the concept of probability was already examined in [[Medieval Roman law|medieval law]] and by philosophers such as [[Juan Caramuel]].<ref>J. Franklin, The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability before Pascal,Johns Hopkins Univ Pr 2002</ref> The [[method of least squares]] was first described by  [[Adrien-Marie Legendre]] in 1805.\n\n[[File:Mw160883.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[Karl Pearson]], the founder of [[mathematical statistics]].]]\nThe modern field of statistics emerged in the late 19th and early 20th century in three stages.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jYFRAAAAMAAJ|title=Studies in the history of statistical method|author=Helen Mary Walker|year=1975|publisher=Arno Press}}</ref> The first wave, at the turn of the century, was led by the work of Sir [[Francis Galton]] and [[Karl Pearson]], who transformed statistics into a rigorous mathematical discipline used for analysis, not just in science, but in industry and politics as well.

His paper was the first to use the statistical term, [[variance]]. He developed rigorous [[design of experiments|experimental models]] and also originated the concepts of [[sufficiency (statistics)|sufficiency]], [[ancillary statistic]]s, [[linear discriminant analysis|Fisher's linear discriminator]] and [[Fisher information]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Agresti|first=Alan|coauthors=David B.

They introduced the concepts of \"[[Type I and type II errors|Type II]]\" error, power of a test and [[confidence interval]]s. [[Jerzy Neyman]] in 1934 showed that stratified random sampling was in general a better method of estimation than purposive (quota) sampling.<ref>Neyman, J (1934) On the two different aspects of the representative method: The method of stratified sampling and the method of purposive selection. ''[[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society]]'' 97 (4) 557-625 {{jstor|2342192}}</ref> Today, statistical methods are applied in all fields that involve decision making, for making accurate inferences from a collated body of data and for making decisions in the face of uncertainty based on statistical methodology. The use of modern [[computer]]s has expedited large-scale statistical computations, and has also made possible new methods that are impractical to perform manually.\n\n==Overview==\nIn applying statistics to a scientific, industrial, or societal problem, it is necessary to begin with a [[statistical population|population]] or process to be studied. Populations can be diverse topics such as \"all persons living in a country\" or \"every atom composing a crystal\". A population can also be composed of observations of a process at various times, with the data from each observation serving as a different member of the overall group.  Data collected about this kind of \"population\" constitutes what is called a [[time series]].\n\nFor practical reasons, a chosen subset of the population called a [[sampling (statistics)|sample]] is studied\u2014as opposed to compiling data about the entire group (an operation called [[census]]). Once a sample that is representative of the population is determined, data is collected for the sample members in an observational or [[experiment]]al setting. This data can then be subjected to statistical analysis, serving two related purposes: description and inference.\n* [[Descriptive statistics]] summarize the population data by describing what was observed in the sample numerically or graphically. Numerical descriptors include [[mean]] and [[standard deviation]] for [[Continuous probability distribution|continuous data]] types (like heights or weights), while frequency and percentage are more useful in terms of describing [[categorical data]] (like race).\n* [[Inferential statistics]] uses patterns in the sample data to draw inferences about the population represented, accounting for randomness. These inferences may take the form of: answering yes/no questions about the data ([[hypothesis testing]]), estimating numerical characteristics of the data ([[Estimation theory|estimation]]), describing [[Association (statistics)|associations]] within the data ([[correlation and dependence|correlation]]) and modeling relationships within the data (for example, using [[regression analysis]]).  Inference can extend to [[forecasting]], [[prediction]] and estimation of unobserved values either in or associated with the population being studied; it can include [[extrapolation]] and [[interpolation]] of time series or [[spatial data analysis|spatial data]], and can also include [[data mining]].<ref>{{cite journal | authorlink = Leo Breiman | first = Leo | last = Breiman | year = 2001 | id = {{citeseerx|10.1.1.156.4933}} | title = Statistical Modelling: the two cultures | journal = [[Statistical Science]] | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 199\u2013231 | doi = 10.1214/ss/1009213726 | mr = 1874152 }}</ref>\n{{Quote box\n | quote = \"... it is only the manipulation of uncertainty that interests us.

Statistical analysis of a [[data set]] often reveals that two variables (properties) of the population under consideration tend to vary together, as if they were connected. For example, a study of annual income that also looks at age of death might find that poor people tend to have shorter lives than affluent people. The two variables are said to be correlated; however, they may or may not be the cause of one another. The correlation phenomena could be caused by a third, previously unconsidered phenomenon, called a lurking variable or [[confounding variable]]. For this reason, there is no way to immediately infer the existence of a causal relationship between the two variables. (See [[Correlation does not imply causation]].)\n\nTo use a sample as a guide to an entire population, it is important that it truly represent the overall population. Representative [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]] assures that inferences and conclusions can safely extend from the sample to the population as a whole. A major problem lies in determining the extent that the sample chosen is actually representative. Statistics offers methods to estimate and correct for any random trending within the sample and data collection procedures. There are also methods of [[experimental design]] for experiments that can lessen these issues at the outset of a study, strengthening its capability to discern truths about the population.\n\nRandomness is studied using the [[mathematics|mathematical discipline]] of [[probability theory]]. Probability is used in \"[[mathematical statistics]]\" (alternatively, \"[[statistical theory]]\") to study the [[sampling distribution]]s of [[sample statistic]]s and, more generally, the properties of [[statistical decision theory|statistical procedures]]. The use of any statistical method is valid when the system or population under consideration satisfies the  assumptions of the method.\n\n[[Misuse of statistics]] can produce subtle, but serious errors in description and interpretation\u2014subtle in the sense that even experienced professionals make such errors, and serious in the sense that they can lead to devastating decision errors. For instance, social policy, medical practice, and the reliability of structures like bridges all rely on the proper use of statistics. [[#Misuse|See below]] for further discussion.\n\nEven when statistical techniques are correctly applied, the results can be difficult to interpret for those lacking expertise. The [[statistical significance]] of a trend in the data\u2014which measures the extent to which a trend could be caused by random variation in the sample\u2014may or may not agree with an intuitive sense of its significance. The set of basic statistical skills (and skepticism) that people need to deal with information in their everyday lives properly is referred to as [[statistical literacy]].\n\n==Statistical methods==\n\n===Experimental and observational studies===\nA common goal for a statistical research project is to investigate [[causality]], and in particular to draw a conclusion on the effect of changes in the values of predictors or [[independent variable]]s on [[dependent variable]]s or response. There are two major types of causal statistical studies: [[controlled experiment|experimental studies]] and [[observational study|observational studies]]. In both types of studies, the effect of differences of an independent variable (or variables) on the behavior of the dependent variable are observed. The difference between the two types lies in how the study is actually conducted. Each can be very effective.\nAn experimental study involves taking measurements of the system under study, manipulating the system, and then taking additional measurements using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements. In contrast, an observational study does not involve experimental manipulation. Instead, data are gathered and correlations between predictors and response are investigated.\n\n====Experiments====\nThe basic steps of a statistical experiment are:\n# Planning the research, including finding the number of replicates of the study, using the following information:  preliminary estimates regarding the size of [[Average treatment effect|treatment effects]], [[alternative hypothesis|alternative hypotheses]], and the estimated [[experimental error|experimental variability]]. Consideration of the selection of experimental subjects and the ethics of research is necessary. Statisticians recommend that experiments compare (at least) one new treatment with a standard treatment or control, to allow an unbiased estimate of the difference in treatment effects.\n# [[Design of experiments]], using [[blocking (statistics)|blocking]] to reduce the influence of [[confounding variable]]s, and  [[randomized assignment]] of treatments to subjects to allow [[bias of an estimator|unbiased estimates]] of treatment effects and experimental error. At this stage, the experimenters and statisticians write the ''[[protocol (natural sciences)|experimental protocol]]'' that shall guide the performance of the experiment and that specifies the'' primary analysis'' of the experimental data.\n# Performing the experiment following the [[Protocol (natural sciences)|experimental protocol]] and [[analysis of variance|analyzing the data]] following the experimental protocol.\n# Further examining the data set in secondary analyses, to suggest new hypotheses for future study.\n# Documenting and presenting the results of the study.\n\nExperiments on human behavior have special concerns. The famous [[Hawthorne study]] examined changes to the working environment at the Hawthorne plant of the [[Western Electric Company]]. The researchers were interested in determining whether increased illumination would increase the productivity of the [[assembly line]] workers. The researchers first measured the productivity in the plant, then modified the illumination in an area of the plant and checked if the changes in illumination affected productivity. It turned out that productivity indeed improved (under the experimental conditions). However, the study is heavily criticized today for errors in experimental procedures, specifically for the lack of a [[control group]] and [[double-blind|blindness]]. The [[Hawthorne effect]] refers to finding that an outcome (in this case, worker productivity) changed due to observation itself. Those in the Hawthorne study became more productive not because the lighting was changed but because they were being observed.<ref name=\"pmid17608932\">{{cite journal |author=McCarney R, Warner J, Iliffe S, van Haselen R, Griffin M, Fisher P |title=The Hawthorne Effect: a randomised, controlled trial |journal=BMC Med Res Methodol |volume=7|pages=30 |year=2007 |pmid=17608932 |pmc=1936999 |doi=10.1186/1471-2288-7-30}}</ref>\n\n====Observational study====\nAn example of an observational study is one that explores the correlation between smoking and lung cancer. This type of study typically uses a survey to collect observations about the area of interest and then performs statistical analysis. In this case, the researchers would collect observations of both smokers and non-smokers, perhaps through a [[case-control study]], and then look for the number of cases of lung cancer in each group.\n\n===Levels of measurement===\n{{Main|Levels of measurement}}\n\nVarious attempts have been made to produce a taxonomy of [[level of measurement|levels of measurement]]. The psychophysicist [[Stanley Smith Stevens]] defined nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio scales. Nominal measurements do not have meaningful rank order among values, and permit any one-to-one transformation. Ordinal measurements have imprecise differences between consecutive values, but have a meaningful order to those values, and permit any order-preserving transformation. Interval measurements have meaningful distances between measurements defined, but the zero value is arbitrary (as in the case with [[longitude]] and [[temperature]] measurements in [[Celsius]] or [[Fahrenheit]]), and permit any linear transformation. Ratio measurements have both a meaningful zero value and the distances between different measurements defined, and permit any rescaling transformation.\n\nBecause variables conforming only to nominal or ordinal measurements cannot be reasonably measured numerically, sometimes they are grouped together as [[categorical variable]]s, whereas ratio and interval measurements are grouped together as [[Variable (mathematics)#Applied statistics|quantitative variables]], which can be either [[Probability distribution#Discrete probability distribution|discrete]] or [[Probability distribution#Continuous probability distribution|continuous]], due to their numerical nature.\n\nOther categorizations have been proposed. For example, Mosteller and Tukey (1977)<ref>Mosteller, F., & Tukey, J. W. (1977). ''Data analysis and regression''. Boston: Addison-Wesley.</ref> distinguished grades, ranks, counted fractions, counts, amounts, and balances. Nelder (1990)<ref>Nelder, J. A. (1990). The knowledge needed to computerise the analysis and interpretation of statistical information. In ''Expert systems and artificial intelligence: the need for information about data''. Library Association Report, London, March, 23-27.</ref> described continuous counts, continuous ratios, count ratios, and categorical modes of data. See also Chrisman (1998),<ref>Chrisman, Nicholas R. (1998). Rethinking Levels of Measurement for Cartography.

Leiden: DSWO Press</ref>\n\nThe issue of whether or not it is appropriate to apply different kinds of statistical methods to data obtained from different kinds of measurement procedures is complicated by issues concerning the transformation of variables and the precise interpretation of research questions. \"The relationship between the data and what they describe merely reflects the fact that certain kinds of statistical statements may have truth values which are not invariant under some transformations. Whether or not a transformation is sensible to contemplate depends on the question one is trying to answer\" (Hand, 2004, p.&nbsp;82).<ref>Hand, D. J. (2004). ''Measurement theory and practice: The world through quantification.'' London, UK: Arnold.</ref>\n\n===Key terms used in statistics===\n\n====Statistics, estimators and pivotal quantities====\n\nConsider n [[Independent identically distributed|independent identically distributed (iid) random variables]] with a given [[probability distribution]]: standard [[statistical inference]] and [[estimation theory]] defines a [[random sample]] as the [[random vector]] given by the [[column vector]] of these iid variables.<ref>P. Elio, Probabilit\u00e0 e Statistica, Esculapio 2007</ref> The [[Statistical population|population]] being examined is described by a probability distribution which may have unknown parameters.\n\nA [[statistic]] is random variable which is a function of the random sample, but ''not a function of unknown parameters''. The probability distribution of the statistics, though, may have unknown parameters.\n\nConsider now a function of the unknown parameter: an [[estimator]] is a statistic used to estimate such function. Commonly used estimators include [[Sample mean#Sample mean|sample mean]], unbiased [[sample variance]] and [[Sample covariance#Sample covariance|sample covariance]].\n\nA random variable which is a function of the random sample and of the unknown parameter, but whose probability distribution ''does not depend on the unknown parameter'' is called a [[pivotal quantity]] or pivot. Widely used pivots include the [[z-score]], the [[Chi-squared distribution#Applications|chi square statistic]] and Student's [[Student's t-distribution#How the t-distribution arises|t-value]].\n\nBetween two estimators of a given parameter, the one with lower [[mean squared error]] is said to be more [[Efficient estimator|efficient]]. Furthermore an estimator is said to be [[Unbiased estimator|unbiased]] if it's [[expected value]] is equal to the true value of the unknown parameter which is being estimated and asymptotically unbiased if its expected value converges at the [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]] to the true value of such parameter.\n\nOther desirable properties for estimators include: [[UMVUE]] estimators which have the lowest variance for all possible values of the parameter to be estimated (this is usually an easier property to verify than efficiency) and [[Consistency (statistics)|consistent]] estimators which [[converges in probability]] to the true value of such parameter.\n\nThis still leaves the question of how to obtain estimators in a given situation and carry the computation, several methods have been proposed: the [[method of moments (statistics)|method of moments]], the [[maximum likelihood]] method, the [[least squares]] method and the more recent method of [[estimating equations]].\n\n====Null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis====\nInterpretation of statistical information can often involve the development of a [[null hypothesis]] in that the assumption is that whatever is proposed as a cause has no effect on the variable being measured.\n\nThe best illustration for a novice is the predicament encountered by a jury trial. The null hypothesis, H<sub>0</sub>, asserts that the defendant is innocent, whereas the alternative hypothesis, H<sub>1</sub>, asserts that the defendant is guilty. The indictment comes because of suspicion of the guilt. The H<sub>0</sub> (status quo) stands in opposition to H<sub>1</sub> and is maintained unless H<sub>1</sub> is supported by evidence \"beyond a reasonable doubt\". However, \"failure to reject H<sub>0</sub>\" in this case does not imply innocence, but merely that the evidence was insufficient to convict. So the jury does not necessarily ''accept'' H<sub>0</sub> but ''fails to reject'' H<sub>0</sub>. While one can not \"prove\" a null hypothesis, one can test how close it is to being true with a [[Statistical power|power test]], which tests for type II errors.\n\nWhat [[statisticians]] call a [[alternative hypothesis]] is simply an hypothesis which contradicts the [[null hypothesis]].\n\n====Error====\nWorking from a [[null hypothesis]] two basic forms of error are recognized:\n*[[Type I and type II errors#Type I error|Type I errors]] where the null hypothesis is falsely rejected giving a \"false positive\".\n*[[Type I and type II errors#Type II error|Type II errors]] where the null hypothesis fails to be rejected and an actual difference between populations is missed giving a \"false negative\".\n\n[[Standard deviation]] refers to the extent to which individual observations in a sample differ from a central value, such as the sample or population mean, while [[Standard error (statistics)#Standard error of the mean|Standard error]] refers to an estimate of difference between sample mean and population mean.\n\nA [[Errors and residuals in statistics#Introduction|statistical error]] is the amount by which an observation differs from its [[expected value]], a [[Errors and residuals in statistics#Introduction|residual]] is the amount an observation differs from the value the estimator of the expected value assumes on a given sample (also called prediction).\n\n[[Mean squared error]] is used for obtaining [[efficient estimators]], a widely used class of estimators. [[Root mean square error]] is simply the square root of mean squared error.\n\nMany statistical methods seek to minimize the [[residual sum of squares]], and these are called \"[[least squares|methods of least squares]]\" in contrast to [[Least absolute deviations]]. The later gives equal weight to small and big errors, while the former gives more weight to large errors. Residual sum of squares is also [[differentiable]], which provides a handy property for doing [[regression analysis|regression]]. Least squares applied to [[linear regression]] is called [[ordinary least squares]] method and least squares applied to [[nonlinear regression]] is called [[non-linear least squares]]. Also in a linear regression model the non deterministic part of the model is called error term, disturbance or more simply noise.\n\nMeasurement processes that generate statistical data are also subject to error.  Many of these errors are classified as [[Random error|random]] (noise) or [[Systematic error|systematic]] ([[bias]]), but other important types of errors (e.g., blunder, such as when an analyst reports incorrect units) can also be important. The presence of [[missing data]] and/or [[censoring (statistics)|censoring]] may result in [[bias (statistics)|biased estimates]] and specific techniques have been developed to adress these problems.<ref>Rubin, Donald B.; Little, Roderick J. A.,Statistical analysis with missing data, New York: Wiley 2002</ref>\n\n====Interval estimation====\n{{Main|Interval estimation}}\nMost studies only sample part of a population, so results don't fully represent the whole population. Any estimates obtained from the sample only approximate the population value. [[Confidence intervals]] allow statisticians to express how closely the sample estimate matches the true value in the whole population. Often they are expressed as 95% confidence intervals. Formally, a 95% confidence interval for a value is a range where, if the sampling and analysis were repeated under the same conditions (yielding a different dataset), the interval would include the true (population) value in 95% of all possible cases. This does ''not'' imply that the probability that the true value is in the confidence interval is 95%. From the [[frequentist inference|frequentist]] perspective, such a claim does not even make sense, as the true value is not a [[random variable]].  Either the true value is or is not within the given interval. However, it is true that, before any data are sampled and given a plan for how to construct the confidence interval, the probability is 95% that the yet-to-be-calculated interval will cover the true value: at this point, the limits of the interval are yet-to-be-observed [[random variable]]s. One approach that does yield an interval that can be interpreted as having a given probability of containing the true value is to use a [[credible interval]] from [[Bayesian statistics]]: this approach depends on a different way of [[Probability interpretations|interpreting what is meant by \"probability\"]], that is as a [[Bayesian probability]].\n\nIn principle confidence intervals can be symmetrical or asymmetrical. An interval can be asymmetrical because it works as lower or upper bound for a parameter (left-sided interval or right sided interval), but it can also be asymmetrical because the two sided interval is built violating symmetry around the estimate. Sometimes the bounds for a confidence interval are reached asymptotically and these are used to approximate the true bounds.\n\n====Significance====\n{{Main|Statistical significance}}\n{{No footnotes|section|date=May 2012}}\nStatistics rarely give a simple Yes/No type answer to the question asked of them. Interpretation often comes down to the level of statistical significance applied to the numbers and often refers to the probability of a value accurately rejecting the null hypothesis (sometimes referred to as the [[p-value]]).\n\nReferring to statistical significance does not necessarily mean that the overall result is significant in real world terms. For example, in a large study of a drug it may be shown that the drug has a statistically significant but very small beneficial effect, such that the drug is unlikely to help the patient noticeably.\n\nCriticisms arise because the hypothesis testing approach forces one hypothesis (the [[null hypothesis]]) to be \"favored,\" and can also seem to exaggerate the importance of minor differences in large studies. A difference that is highly statistically significant can still be of no practical significance, but it is possible to properly formulate tests in account for this. (See also [[Statistical hypothesis testing#Criticism|criticism of hypothesis testing]].)\n\nOne response involves going beyond reporting only the [[significance level]] to include the [[p-value|''p''-value]] when reporting whether a hypothesis is rejected or accepted. The ''p''-value, however, does not indicate the size of the effect. A better and increasingly common approach is to report [[confidence interval]]s. Although these are produced from the same calculations as those of hypothesis tests or ''p''-values, they describe both the size of the effect and the uncertainty surrounding it.\n\n===Examples===\nSome well-known statistical [[Statistical hypothesis testing|tests]] and [[Procedure (term)|procedures]] are:\n\n{{Columns-list|2|\n* [[Analysis of variance]] (ANOVA)\n* [[Chi-squared test]]\n* [[Correlation]]\n* [[Factor analysis]]\n* [[Mann\u2013Whitney U|Mann\u2013Whitney ''U'']]\n* [[Mean square weighted deviation]] (MSWD)\n* [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient]]\n* [[Regression analysis]]\n* [[Spearman's rank correlation coefficient]]\n* [[Student's t-test|Student's ''t''-test]]\n* [[Time series analysis]]\n}}\n\n==Specialized disciplines==\n{{Main|List of fields of application of statistics}}\n\nStatistical techniques are used in a wide range of types of scientific and social research, including: [[biostatistics]],  [[computational biology]],  [[computational sociology]],  [[network biology]],  [[social science]],  [[sociology]] and  [[social research]]. Some fields of inquiry use applied statistics so extensively that they have [[specialized terminology]]. These disciplines include:\n\n{{Columns-list|2|\n* [[Actuarial science]] (assesses risk in the insurance and finance industries)\n* [[Applied information economics]]\n* [[Biostatistics]]\n* [[Business statistics]]\n* [[Chemometrics]] (for analysis of data from [[chemistry]])\n* [[Data mining]] (applying statistics and [[pattern recognition]] to discover knowledge from data)\n* [[Demography]]\n* [[Econometrics]]\n* [[Energy statistics]]\n* [[Engineering statistics]]\n* [[Epidemiology]]\n* [[Geography]] and [[Geographic Information Systems]], specifically in [[Spatial analysis]]\n* [[Image processing]]\n* [[Psychological statistics]]\n* [[Reliability engineering]]\n* [[Social statistics]]\n}}\n\nIn addition, there are particular types of statistical analysis that have also developed their own specialised terminology and methodology:\n{{Columns-list|2|\n* [[Bootstrapping (statistics)|Bootstrap]] & [[Resampling (statistics)|Jackknife Resampling]]\n* [[Multivariate statistics]]\n* [[Statistical classification]]\n* [[Statistical survey]]s\n* [[Structured data analysis (statistics)]]\n* [[Structural equation modelling]]\n* [[Survival analysis]]\n* Statistics in various sports, particularly [[Baseball statistics|baseball]] and [[Cricket statistics|cricket]]\n}}\n\nStatistics form a key basis tool in business and manufacturing as well. It is used to understand measurement systems variability, control processes (as in [[statistical process control]] or SPC), for summarizing data, and to make data-driven decisions. In these roles, it is a key tool, and perhaps the only reliable tool.\n\n==Statistical computing==\n[[File:Gretl screenshot.png|thumb|300px|[[gretl]], an example of an [[open source]] statistical package]]\n{{Main|Computational statistics}}\n\nThe rapid and sustained increases in computing power starting from the second half of the 20th century have had a substantial impact on the practice of statistical science. Early statistical models were almost always from the class of [[linear model]]s, but powerful computers, coupled with suitable numerical [[algorithms]], caused an increased interest in [[nonlinear regression|nonlinear models]] (such as [[neural networks]]) as well as the creation of new types, such as [[generalized linear model]]s and [[multilevel model]]s.\n\nIncreased computing power has also led to the growing popularity of computationally intensive methods based on [[resampling (statistics)|resampling]], such as permutation tests and the [[bootstrapping (statistics)|bootstrap]], while techniques such as [[Gibbs sampling]] have made use of Bayesian models more feasible. The computer revolution has implications for the future of statistics with new emphasis on \"experimental\" and \"empirical\" statistics. A large number of both general and special purpose [[List of statistical packages|statistical software]] are now available.\n\n==Misuse==\n{{Main|Misuse of statistics}}\n\nThere is a general perception that statistical knowledge is all-too-frequently intentionally [[Misuse of statistics|misused]] by finding ways to interpret only the data that are favorable to the presenter.<ref name=Huff>Huff, Darrell (1954) ''[[How to Lie with Statistics]]'',  WW Norton & Company, Inc.

This has changed with use of statistics in non-inferential contexts. What was once considered a dry subject, taken in many fields as a degree-requirement, is now viewed enthusiastically.{{according to whom|date=April 2014}} Initially derided by some mathematical purists, it is now considered essential methodology in certain areas.\n* In [[number theory]], [[scatter plot]]s of data generated by a distribution function may be transformed with familiar tools used in statistics to reveal underlying patterns, which may then lead to hypotheses.\n* Methods of statistics including predictive methods in [[forecasting]] are combined with [[chaos theory]] and [[fractal geometry]] to create video works that are considered to have great beauty.\n* The [[process art]] of [[Jackson Pollock]] relied on artistic experiments whereby underlying distributions in nature were artistically revealed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} With the advent of computers, statistical methods were applied to formalize such distribution-driven natural processes to make and analyze moving video art.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n* Methods of statistics may be used predicatively in [[performance art]], as in a card trick based on a [[Markov process]] that only works some of the time, the occasion of which can be predicted using statistical methodology.\n* Statistics can be used to predicatively create art, as in the statistical or [[stochastic music]] invented by [[Iannis Xenakis]], where the music is performance-specific. Though this type of artistry does not always come out as expected, it does behave in ways that are predictable and tunable using statistics.\n\n==See also==\n{{Sister project links|Statistics}}\n{{Library resources box \n|by=no \n|onlinebooks=no \n|others=no \n|about=yes \n|label=Statistics}}\n{{Main|Outline of statistics}}\n<!-- NOTE: This is mainly for statistics-related lists.

Ogden states that according to an edict written by Diocletian, a silversmith was able to charge, 75, 150 or 300 ''denarii'' for material produce (per Roman pound). At that time, guilds of silversmiths formed to look out for the welfare of their number.<ref name=\" Ogden\">{{cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oCBt7B7nt5QC&pg=PA58&dq=Egyptian+Silversmithing&hl=en&sa=X&ei=hq6ET_n8GejQ0QWDp5TZBw&ved=0CFkQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&q=Egyptian%20Silversmithing&f=false |author=Jack Ogden |title=Ancient Jewellery | year= |publisher=University of California Press, 7 Jul 1992| accessdate=2012-04-10}}</ref>\n\nSilversmiths in medieval Europe and England formed guilds and transmitted their tools and techniques to new generations via the [[apprentice]] tradition.  Silverworking guilds often maintained consistency and upheld standards at the expense of innovation.  Beginning in the 17th century, artisans emigrated to America and experienced fewer restrictions.  As a result, silverworking was one of the trades that helped to inaugurate the [[Technological and industrial history of the United States#Silverworking|shift to industrialization]] in America.\n\n==Tools, materials and techniques==\n[[File:T&T Hand-hammered dish.jpg|thumb|right|Dish made by hand-hammering]]\n\n*[[saw]] (jeweler's saw)\n*[[snips]]\n* flat [[file (tool)|file]]\n* half-round file\n* jewelers' file\n* planishing [[hammer]]\n* raising hammer\n* cross-pein hammer\n* ball-pein hammer\n*[[anvil]]s\n*[[wiktionary:stake|stakes]]\n*[[swage block]]s\n*[[riveting]]\n*silver hard-[[solder]]\n*[[Flux (metallurgy)|flux]]\n**[[borax]]\n**[[boric acid]]\n*[[torch]] or [[blow-pipe]]\n*[[Pickling (metal)|pickle]] (Dilute sulphuric acid or organic acids which are used to remove [[firescale]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Brain|first=Charles|title=Pickling Notes|url=http://www.ganoksin.com/borisat/nenam/pickling-notes.htm|publisher=The Ganoksin Project|accessdate=15 June 2013}}</ref>)\n*[[buffing wheel]]s\n* [[polishing]] compounds.\n*[[chasing]]\n* [[repousse]]\n*[[engraving]]\n\nSilversmiths saw or cut specific shapes from sterling and fine silver sheet metal and bar stock, and then use hammers to form the metal over anvils and stakes. Silver is hammered cold (at room temperature). As the metal is hammered, bent, and worked, it 'work-hardens'. [[Annealing (metallurgy)|Annealing]] is the heat-treatment used to make the metal soft again. If metal is work-hardened, and not annealed occasionally, the metal will crack and weaken the work.\n\nSilversmiths can use [[casting]] techniques to create knobs, handles and feet for the hollowware they are making.\n\nAfter forming and casting, the various pieces may be assembled by [[solder]]ing and [[rivet]]ing\n\nDuring most of their history, silversmiths used [[charcoal]] or [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] fired [[forges]], and lung-powered [[blow-pipe]]s for soldering and annealing. Modern silversmiths commonly use gas burning torches as heat sources. A newer method is [[laser beam welding]].\n\nSilversmiths may also work in [[copper]] and [[brass]], although this is usually confined to practice pieces due to the cost of the metals\n\n== Related and overlapping trades ==\n[[File:Silver band.png|thumb|upright|right|Band made of silver]]\n\nAlthough [[jeweler]]s also work in silver and gold, and many of the techniques for working [[precious metal]]s overlap, the trades of jeweler and Silversmith have distinct histories.\n[[Chain]]-making and [[Gemstone|gem]]-setting are common practices of jewelers that are not usually considered aspects of silversmiths.\n\nThe tradition of making ([[iron]] / plate) [[armor]] was interrupted sometime after the 17th century.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Silversmithing and goldsmithing, by contrast, have an unbroken tradition going back many millennia.

It is concerned with the development, improvement, implementation and evaluation of integrated systems of people, money, knowledge, information, equipment, energy, materials, analysis and [[:wikt:synthesis|synthesis]], as well as the mathematical, physical and [[social sciences]] together with the principles and methods of engineering design to specify, predict, and evaluate the results to be obtained from such systems or processes. Its underlying concepts overlap considerably with certain business-oriented disciplines such as [[operations management]].\n\nDepending on the subspecialties involved, industrial engineering may also be known as, or overlap with, operations management, [[management science]], [[operations research]], [[systems engineering]], [[management engineering]], [[manufacturing engineering]], [[ergonomics]] or [[human factors]] engineering, [[safety engineering]], or others, depending on the viewpoint or motives of the user. For example, in health care, the engineers known as health [[management engineering|management engineers]] or health systems engineers are, in essence, [[industrial engineer]]s by another name.\n\n== Overview ==\nWhile the term originally applied to manufacturing, the use of \"industrial\" in \"industrial engineering\" can be somewhat misleading, since it has grown to encompass any methodical or quantitative approach to optimizing how a process, system, or organization operates. Some engineering universities and educational agencies around the world have changed the term \"industrial\" to broader terms such as \"production\" or \"systems\", leading to the typical extensions noted above. In fact, the primary U.S. professional organization for Industrial Engineers, the [[Institute of Industrial Engineers]] (IIE) has been considering changing its name to something broader (such as the Institute of Industrial & Systems Engineers), although the latest vote among membership deemed this unnecessary for the time being.\n\nThe various topics concerning industrial engineers include [[management science]], work-study, [[financial engineering]], [[engineering management]], [[supply chain management]], [[process engineering]], [[operations research]], [[systems engineering]], [[ergonomics]] / [[safety engineering]], cost and [[value engineering]], [[quality assurance|quality engineering]], facilities planning, and the engineering design process. Traditionally, a major aspect of industrial engineering was [[Plant layout study|planning the layouts of factories]] and designing assembly lines and other manufacturing paradigms. And now, in so-called [[lean manufacturing]] systems, industrial engineers work to eliminate wastes of time, money, materials, energy, and other resources.\n\nExamples of where industrial engineering might be used include flow process charting, process mapping, designing an assembly workstation, strategizing for various operational logistics, consulting as an efficiency expert, developing a new financial algorithm or loan system for a bank, streamlining operation and emergency room location or usage in a hospital, planning complex distribution schemes for materials or products (referred to as [[supply-chain management]]), and shortening lines (or [[queueing theory|queues]]) at a bank, hospital, or a theme park.\n\nModern industrial engineers typically use [[predetermined motion time system]], [[computer simulation]] (especially [[discrete event simulation]]), along with extensive mathematical tools and modeling and computational methods for system analysis, evaluation, and optimization.\n\n==History==\n\n{{See also|List of industrial engineers}}\nEfforts [[applied science|to apply science]] to the design of processes and of production systems were made by many people in the 18th and 19th centuries. They took some time to evolve and to be synthesized into disciplines that we would label with names such as industrial engineering, production engineering, or systems engineering. For example, precursors to industrial engineering included some aspects of [[military science]]; the quest to develop [[interchangeable parts|manufacturing using interchangeable parts]]; the development of the [[American system of manufacturing|armory system of manufacturing]]; the work of [[Henri Fayol]] and colleagues (which grew into a larger movement called [[Fayolism]]); and the work of [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] and colleagues (which grew into a larger movement called [[scientific management]]). In the late 19th century, such efforts began to inform [[consultant|consultancy]] and higher education. The idea of consulting with experts about process engineering naturally evolved into the idea of teaching the concepts as curriculum.\n\nIndustrial engineering courses were taught by multiple universities in Europe at the end of the 19th century, including in Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Spain.<ref>http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=62202</ref> In the United States, the first department of industrial and manufacturing engineering was established in 1909 at the [[Pennsylvania State University]]. The first doctoral degree in industrial engineering was awarded in the 1930s by [[Cornell University]].\n\nIn general it can be said that the foundations of industrial engineering as it looks today, began to be built in the twentieth century. The first half of the century was characterized by an emphasis on increasing efficiency and reducing industrial organizations their costs.\n\nIn 1909, [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|Frederick Taylor]] published his theory of scientific management, which included accurate analysis of human labor, systematic definition of methods, tools and training for employees. Taylor dealt in time using timers, set standard times and managed to increase productivity while reducing labor costs and increasing the wages and salaries of the employees.\n\nIn 1912 [[Henry Laurence Gantt]] developed the Gantt chart which outlines actions the organization along with their relationships. This chart opens later form familiar to us today by [[Henry Wallace Clark|Wallace Clark]].\n\nAssembly lines: moving car factory of [[Henry Ford]] (1913) accounted for a significant leap forward in the field. Ford reduced the assembly time of a car more than 700 hours to 1.5 hours. In addition, he was a pioneer of the economy of the capitalist welfare (\"welfare capitalism\") and the flag of providing financial incentives for employees to increase productivity.\n\nComprehensive quality management system (TQM) developed in the forties was gaining momentum after World War II and was part of the recovery of Japan after the war.\n\nIn 1960 to 1975, with the development of decision support systems in supply such as the MRP, you can emphasize the timing issue (inventory, production, compounding, transportation, etc.) of industrial organization. Israeli scientist Dr. [[Jacob Rubinovitz]] installed the CMMS program developed in IAI and Control-Data (Israel) in 1976 in South Africa and worldwide.\n\nIn the seventies, with the penetration of Japanese management theories such as Kaizen and Kanban West, was transferred to highlight issues of quality, delivery time, and flexibility.\n\nIn the nineties, following the global industry globalization process, the emphasis was on supply chain management, and customer-oriented business process design. [[Theory of constraints]] developed by an Israeli scientist [[Eliyahu M. Goldratt]] (1985) is also a significant milestone in the field.\n\n==University programs==\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:1em; font-size:90%; line-height:1.4em; width:300px;\"\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | '''2012 U.S News Rankings'''<ref>{{cite web | url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/rankings/engineering-doctorate-industrial-manufacturing| title=U.S News Rankings | date=November 13, 2012 | publisher=U.S News | accessdate=November 13, 2013}}</ref>\n|-\n| '''University''' || '''Rank'''\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |<hr>\n|-\n| [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] || 1\n|-\n| [[University of Michigan, Ann Arbor]] || 2\n|-\n| [[University of California, Berkeley]] || 3\n|-\n| [[Purdue University]] || 4\n|-\n| [[Stanford University]] || 5\n|-\n| [[Texas A&M University]] || 6\n|-\n| [[Northwestern University]]|| 7\n|-\n| [[Pennsylvania State University]] || 8\n|-\n| [[University of Wisconsin]] || 9\n|-\n| [[Virginia Tech]] || 10\n\n|}\n\nMany universities have BS, MS, MTech and PhD programs available.

Agricola has been described as the \"father of metallurgy\".<ref>[[Karl Alfred von Zittel]] (1901) ''History of Geology and Palaeontology'', p. 15</ref>\n\n==Extraction==\n[[File:Yuan Dynasty - waterwheels and smelting.png|thumb|Furnace bellows operated by [[waterwheel]]s, [[Yuan Dynasty]], China.]]\n[[File:\u017diar nad Hronom2.JPG|thumb|right|Aluminium plant in [[\u017diar nad Hronom]] (Central [[Slovakia]])]]\n{{main|Extractive metallurgy}}\n[[Extractive metallurgy]] is the practice of removing valuable metals from an [[ore]] and refining the extracted raw metals into a purer form. In order to convert a metal [[oxide]] or [[sulfide]] to a purer metal, the ore must be [[redox|reduced]] physically, [[chemistry|chemically]], or [[electrolyte|electrolytically]].\n\nExtractive metallurgists are interested in three primary streams: feed, concentrate (valuable metal oxide/sulfide), and [[tailings]] (waste). After mining, large pieces of the ore feed are broken through crushing and/or grinding in order to obtain particles small enough where each particle is either mostly valuable or mostly waste. Concentrating the particles of value in a form supporting separation enables the desired metal to be removed from waste products.\n\nMining may not be necessary if the ore body and physical environment are conducive to [[In-situ leaching|leaching]]. Leaching dissolves minerals in an ore body and results in an enriched solution. The solution is collected and processed to extract valuable metals.\n\nOre bodies often contain more than one valuable metal. Tailings of a previous process may be used as a feed in another process to extract a secondary product from the original ore. Additionally, a concentrate may contain more than one valuable metal. That concentrate would then be processed to separate the valuable metals into individual constituents.\n\n==Alloys==\n[[File:Bois-du-Luc - Fondeur d'art 2.JPG|thumb|Casting bronze]]\n\nCommon engineering [[metal]]s include [[aluminium]], [[chromium]], [[copper]], [[iron]], [[magnesium]], [[nickel]], [[titanium]] and [[zinc]]. These are most often used as alloys. Much effort has been placed on understanding the iron-carbon alloy system, which includes [[steel]]s and [[cast iron]]s. [[carbon steel|Plain carbon steels]] (those that contain essentially only carbon as an alloying element) are used in low cost, high strength applications where weight and [[corrosion]] are not a problem. Cast irons, including [[ductile iron]] are also part of the iron-carbon system.\n\n[[Stainless steel]] or [[galvanized steel]] are used where resistance to corrosion is important. Aluminium alloys and magnesium alloys are used for applications where strength and lightness are required.\n\nCopper-nickel alloys (such as [[Monel]]) are used in highly corrosive environments and for non-magnetic applications. Nickel-based [[superalloy]]s like [[Inconel]] are used in high temperature applications such as [[turbochargers]], [[pressure vessel]], and [[heat exchangers]]. For extremely high temperatures, [[single crystal]] alloys are used to minimize [[Creep (deformation)|creep]].\n\n==Production==\nIn [[industrial engineering|production engineering]], metallurgy is concerned with the production of metallic components for use in consumer or [[engineering]] products. This involves the production of alloys, the shaping, the heat treatment and the surface treatment of the product. The task of the metallurgist is to achieve balance between material properties such as cost, [[weight]], [[tensile strength|strength]], [[toughness]], [[Hardness (materials science)|hardness]], [[corrosion]], [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]] resistance, and performance in [[temperature]] extremes. To achieve this goal, the operating environment must be carefully considered. In a saltwater environment, ferrous metals and some aluminium alloys corrode quickly. Metals exposed to cold or [[cryogenic]] conditions may endure a ductile to brittle transition and lose their toughness, becoming more brittle and prone to cracking. Metals under continual cyclic loading can suffer from metal fatigue. Metals under constant [[stress (physics)|stress]] at elevated temperatures can [[creep (deformation)|creep]].\n\n===Metalworking processes===\n{{Main|Metalworking}}\n\nMetals are shaped by processes such as:\n*[[Casting (metalworking)|casting]] \u2013 molten metal is poured into a shaped [[Molding (process)|mold]].\n*[[forging]] \u2013 a red-hot [[Billet (manufacturing)|billet]] is hammered into shape.\n*[[Flow Forming|flow forming]]\n*[[Rolling (metalworking)|rolling]] \u2013 a billet is passed through successively narrower rollers to create a sheet.\n* [[Cladding (metalworking)|Laser cladding]] \u2013 metallic powder is blown through a movable laser beam (e.g. mounted on a NC 5-axis machine). The resulting melted metal reach a substrate to form a melt pool. By moving the laser head, it is possible to stack the tracks and build up a 3D piece.\n*[[extrusion]] \u2013 a hot and malleable metal is forced under pressure through a [[die (manufacturing)|die]], which shapes it before it cools.\n*[[sintering]] \u2013 a [[powder metallurgy|powdered metal]] is heated in a non-oxidizing environment after being compressed into a die.\n*[[metalworking]]\n*[[machining]] \u2013 [[Lathe (tool)|lathes]], [[milling machine]]s, and [[drill]]s cut the cold metal to shape.\n*[[Fabrication (metal)|fabrication]] \u2013 sheets of metal are cut with [[guillotine]]s or [[gas welding|gas cutters]] and bent and welded into structural shape.\n\n[[Cold work]]ing processes, where the product\u2019s shape is altered by rolling, fabrication or other processes while the product is cold, can increase the strength of the product by a process called [[work hardening]]. Work hardening creates [[dislocation|microscopic defects]] in the metal, which resist further changes of shape.\n\nVarious forms of casting exist in industry and academia. These include [[sand casting]], [[investment casting]] (also called the \"[[lost wax process]]\"), [[die casting]] and [[continuous casting]].\n\n===Heat treatment===\nMetals can be [[heat treatment|heat treated]] to alter the properties of strength, ductility, toughness, hardness or resistance to corrosion. Common heat treatment processes include [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]], [[precipitation strengthening]], [[quenching]], and [[tempering (metallurgy)|tempering]],.<ref>Arthur Reardon (2011), ''Metallurgy for the Non-Metallurgist'' (2nd edition), ASM International, ISBN 978-1-61503-821-3</ref> The '''annealing''' process softens the metal by heating it and then allowing it to cool very slowly, which gets rid of stresses in the metal and makes the grain structure large and soft-edged so that when the metal is hit or stressed it dents or perhaps bends, rather than breaking; it is also easier to sand, grind, or cut annealed metal. '''Quenching''' is the process of cooling a high-carbon steel very quickly after you have heated it, thus \"freezing\" the steel's molecules in the very hard martensite form, which makes the metal harder. There is a balance between hardness and toughness in any steel, where the harder it is, the less tough or impact-resistant it is, and the more impact-resistant it is, the less hard it is.  '''Tempering''' relieves stresses in the metal that were caused by the hardening process; tempering makes the metal less hard while making it better able to sustain impacts without breaking.  \n\nOften, mechanical and thermal treatments are combined in what is known as thermo-mechanical treatments for better properties and more efficient processing of materials. These processes are common to high alloy special steels, super alloys and titanium alloys.\n\n===Plating===\n{{Main|Plating}}\n\n[[Electroplating]] is a common surface-treatment technique. It involves bonding a thin layer of another metal such as [[gold]], [[silver]], [[chromium]] or [[zinc]] to the surface of the product. It is used to reduce corrosion as well as to improve the product's aesthetic appearance.\n\n===Thermal spraying===\n{{Main|Thermal spraying}}\nThermal spraying techniques are another popular finishing option, and often have better high temperature properties than electroplated coatings.\n\n==Microstructure==\n[[File:AlubronzeCuAl20v500.png|thumb|Metallography allows the metallurgist to study the microstructure of metals.]]\n\nMetallurgists study the microscopic and macroscopic properties using [[metallography]], a technique invented by [[Henry Clifton Sorby]]. In metallography, an alloy of interest is ground flat and polished to a mirror finish. The sample can then be etched to reveal the microstructure and macrostructure of the metal. The sample is then examined in an optical or [[electron microscope]], and the image contrast provides details on the composition, mechanical properties, and processing history.\n\n[[Crystallography]], often using [[diffraction]] of [[x-ray]]s or [[electron]]s, is another valuable tool available to the modern metallurgist. Crystallography allows identification of unknown materials and reveals the crystal structure of the sample. Quantitative crystallography can be used to calculate the amount of phases present as well as the degree of strain to which a sample has been subjected.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Archaeometallurgy]]\n*[[CALPHAD (method)|CALPHAD]]\n*[[Carbonyl metallurgy]]\n*[[Cupellation]]\n*[[Experimental archaeometallurgy]]\n*[[Georg Agricola]]\n*[[Goldbeating]]\n*[[Gold phosphine complex]]\n*[[Metallurgical failure analysis]]\n*[[Mineral industry]]\n*[[Pyrometallurgy]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{AmCyc Poster}}\n* {{commons category-inline|Metallurgy}}\n* {{Wikiversity-inline|Topic:Metallurgical engineering}}\n* [http://books.google.com/books?id=brpx-LtdCLYC&pg=frontcover&d#v=onepage&q&f=true  Metallurgy for the non-Metallurgist]\n\n{{Technology}}\n\n[[Category:Metals]]\n[[Category:Metallurgy| ]]\n[[Category:Numismatics]]\n\n{{Link FA|de}}", "Weld quality assurance": "'''Weld quality assurance''' is the use of technological methods and actions to test or assure the quality of welds, and secondarily to confirm the presence, location and coverage of welds.{{Or?|date=December 2011}} In manufacturing, [[welding|welds]] are used to join two or more metal surfaces.

Acceptable welding requires exact conditions; variations in conditions can render a weld unacceptable. SIP allows the identification of welding faults in real time, measures the stability of welding processes, and enables the optimization of welding processes. \n\n==== Development ====\nThe idea of using electrical data analyzed by algorithms to assess the quality of the welds produced in robotic manufacturing emerged in 1995 from research by Associate Professor Stephen Simpson at the [[University of Sydney]] on the complex physical phenomena that occur in welding arcs. Simpson realized that a way of determining the quality of a weld could be developed without a definitive understanding of those phenomena.<ref>Simpson SW and Gillespie P (1998) \"In-process monitoring of welding processes\u2014a commercial success\", ''Australasian Welding Journal'', '''43''', 16\u201317</ref><ref>Simpson SW, ''Weld quality measurement'', WIPO PCT WO9845078 (1998); US 6288364 (2001); Australia 741965 (2002); Europe (14 countries) 1007263 (2003); Canada 2285561 (2004); South Korea 0503778 (2005)\n</ref><ref>\nSimpson SW, Welding assessment, WIPO PCT WO0143910 (2001); Australia 763689, US 6660965 (2003); Canada 2393773 (2005); PAs: Japan 2001-545030 (2001); China 00817251.X, S.

QA is applied to physical products in pre-production to verify what will be made meets specifications and requirements, and during manufacturing production runs by validating lot samples meet specified quality controls.  QA is also applied to software to verify that features and functionality meet business objectives, and that code is relatively bug free prior to shipping or releasing new software products and versions.\n\nQuality Assurance refers to administrative and procedural activities implemented in a [[quality system]] so that requirements and goals for a product, service or activity will be fulfilled.<ref>[http://asq.org/learn-about-quality/quality-assurance-quality-control/overview/overview.html  ASQ Definition]</ref> It is the systematic measurement, comparison with a standard, monitoring of processes and an associated feedback loop that confers error prevention.<ref>The [[Marketing Accountability Standards Board]] (MASB) endorses this definition as part of its ongoing [http://www.themasb.org/common-language-project/ Common Language: Marketing Activities and Metrics Project].</ref> This can be contrasted with [[quality control]], which is focused on process output.\n\nTwo principles included in Quality Assurance are: \"Fit for purpose\", the product should be suitable for the intended purpose; and \"Right first time\", mistakes should be eliminated. QA includes management of the [[Quality (business)|quality]] of raw materials, assemblies, products and components, services related to production, and [[management]], production and [[inspection]] processes.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nSuitable quality is determined by product users, clients or customers, not by society in general. It is not related to cost, and adjectives or descriptors such as \"high\" and \"poor\" are not applicable. For example, a low priced product may be viewed as having high quality because it is disposable, where another may be viewed as having poor quality because it is not disposable.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n== History==\n\n=== Initial efforts to control the quality of production ===\n\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]], [[guild]]s adopted responsibility for quality control of their members, setting and maintaining certain standards for guild membership{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}.\n\nRoyal governments purchasing material were interested in quality control as customers. For this reason, King [[John of England]] appointed William Wrotham to report about the construction and repair of ships{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}. Centuries later, [[Samuel Pepys]], Secretary to the British [[Admiralty]], appointed multiple such overseers{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}.\n\nPrior to the extensive [[division of labor]] and [[mechanization]] resulting from the [[Industrial Revolution]], it was possible for workers to control the quality of their own products. The Industrial Revolution led to a system in which large groups of people performing a specialized type of work were grouped together under the supervision of a foreman who was appointed to control the quality of work manufactured.\n\n=== Wartime production ===\n\nAt the time of the [[World War I|First World War]], manufacturing processes typically became more complex with larger numbers of workers being supervised. This period saw the widespread introduction of [[mass production]] and [[piece work]], which created problems as workmen could now earn more money by the production of extra [[product (business)|products]], which in turn occasionally led to poor quality workmanship being passed on to the [[assembly line]]s. To counter bad workmanship, full-time [[inspector]]s were introduced to identify, quarantine and ideally correct product quality failures. Quality control by inspection in the 1920s and 1930s led to the growth of quality inspection functions{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}, separately organized from production and large enough to be headed by [[Superintendent (construction)|superintendents]].\n\nThe systematic approach to quality started in industrial manufacturing during the 1930s{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}, mostly in the [[U.S.]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}, when some attention was given to the cost of [[scrap]] and [[rework (electronics)|rework]]. The impact of [[mass production]] required during the [[Second World War]] made it necessary{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} to introduce an improved form of quality control known as [[Statistical Quality Control]], or SQC. Some of the initial work for SQC is credited to [[Walter A. Shewhart]] of [[Bell Labs]], starting with his famous one-page memorandum of 1924.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}.\n\nSQC includes the concept that every production piece cannot be fully inspected into acceptable and non acceptable batches. By extending the inspection phase and making inspection organizations more efficient, it provides inspectors with control tools such as [[Theoretical sampling|sampling]] and [[control chart]]s, even where 100 percent inspection is not practicable. Standard statistical techniques allow the producer to sample and test a certain proportion of the products for quality to achieve the desired level of confidence in the quality of the entire batch or production run.\n\n=== Postwar ===\n\nIn the period following World War II, many countries' manufacturing capabilities that had been destroyed during the war were rebuilt.  [[General Douglas MacArthur]] oversaw the re-building of [[Japan]]. During this time, General MacArthur involved{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} two key individuals in the development of modern quality concepts:  [[W. Edwards Deming]] and [[Joseph Juran]]. Both individuals promoted the collaborative concepts of quality to Japanese business and technical groups, and these groups utilized these concepts in the redevelopment of the Japanese economy.\n\nAlthough there were many individuals trying to lead United States industries towards a more comprehensive approach to quality, the U.S. continued to apply the Quality Control (QC) concepts of inspection and sampling to remove defective product from production lines, essentially ignoring advances in QA for decades{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}.\n\n== Failure testing ==\n\nA valuable process to perform on a whole [[consumer]] product is failure testing or [[stress testing]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} In mechanical terms this is the operation of a product until it fails, often under stresses such as increasing [[vibration]], [[temperature]], and [[humidity]]. This exposes many unanticipated [[weakness]]es in a product, and the data is used to drive engineering and manufacturing [[process improvement]]s. Often quite simple changes can dramatically improve product service, such as changing to [[mold]]-resistant [[paint]] or adding [[Washer (hardware)#Spring and locking washers|lock-washer]] placement to the [[training]] for new assembly personnel.\n\n== Statistical control ==\n\nStatistical control is based on analyses of objective and subjective data.<ref name=\"flexstudy-9561a\">Evans, James R. (1994) [http://www.flexstudy.com/catalog/schpdf.cfm?coursenum=9561a Introduction to Statistical Process Control], ''Fundamentals of Statistical Process Control'', pp 1-13</ref> Many organizations use [[statistical process control]] as a tool in any quality improvement effort <ref>http://www.nctr.usf.edu/jpt/pdf/JPT%208-2%20Smith_Chaudhry.pdf</ref> to track quality data.

The process(es) which are managed with QA pertain to [[Total Quality Management]].\n\nIf the specification does not reflect the true quality requirements, the product's quality cannot be guaranteed. For instance, the parameters for a pressure vessel should cover not only the material and [[dimension]]s but operating, environmental, [[safety]], [[Reliability engineering|reliability]] and [[maintainability]] requirements.\n\n== QA in software development ==\n{{main|Software quality assurance}}\nSoftware quality assurance consists of a means of monitoring the [[software engineering]] processes and methods used to ensure quality. The methods by which this is accomplished are many and varied, and may include ensuring conformance to one or more standards, such as [[ISO 9000]] or a model such as [[CMMI]].\n\n== Models and standards ==\n\n[[ISO 17025]] is an [[international standard]] that specifies the general requirements for the competence to carry out tests and or [[calibration]]s. There are 15 management requirements and 10 technical requirements. These requirements outline what a laboratory must do to become accredited.\nManagement system refers to the organization's structure for managing its processes or activities that transform inputs of resources into a product or service which meets\nthe organization's objectives, such as satisfying the customer's quality requirements, complying with regulations, or meeting environmental objectives.\n\nThe [[CMMI]] ([[Capability Maturity Model Integration]]) model is widely used to implement Process and Product Quality Assurance (PPQA) in an organization. The CMMI maturity levels can be divided into 5 steps, which a company can achieve by performing specific activities within the organization.\n\n== Company quality ==\n\nDuring the 1980s, the concept of \"company quality\" with the focus on [[management]] and [[people]] came to the fore.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} It was realized that, if all [[Departmentalization|departments]] approached quality with an open mind, success was possible if the management led the quality [[:wikt:improvement|improvement]] process.\n\nThe company-wide quality approach places an emphasis on four aspects{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} :-\n# Elements such as controls, job management, adequate processes, performance and integrity criteria and identification of records\n# Competence such as knowledge, skills, experiences, qualifications\n# Soft elements, such as personnel [[integrity]], [[confidence]], [[organizational culture]], [[motivation]], [[team spirit]] and quality relationships.\n# Infrastructure (as it enhances or limits functionality)\n\nThe quality of the outputs is at risk if any of these aspects is deficient.\n\nQA is not limited to the manufacturing, and can be applied to any business or non-business activity:\n* Design\n* Consulting\n* Banking\n* Insurance\n* Computer software development\n* Retailing\n* Transportation\n* Education\n* Translation\n\nIt comprises a quality improvement process, which is generic in the sense that it can be applied to any of these activities and it establishes a [[behavior pattern]], which supports the achievement of quality.\n\nThis in turn is supported by quality management practices which can include a number of [[business system]]s and which are usually specific to the activities of the [[business unit]] concerned.\n\nIn manufacturing and [[construction]] activities, these business practices can be equated to the models for quality assurance defined by the International Standards contained in the [[ISO 9000]] series and the specified [[Specification]]s for quality systems.\n\nIn the system of Company Quality, the work being carried out was shop floor inspection which did not reveal the major quality problems. This led to quality assurance or total quality control, which has come into being recently.\n\n== Using contractors and/or consultants ==\n\n[[Consultant]]s and contractors are sometimes employed when introducing new quality practices and methods, particularly where the relevant skills and expertise are not available within the organization or when allocating the available internal resources are not available. Consultants and contractors will often employ Quality Management Systems (QMS), auditing and procedural documentation writing [[CMMI]], [[Six Sigma]], [[Measurement Systems Analysis]] (MSA), [[Quality Function Deployment]] (QFD), [[Failure Mode and Effects Analysis]] (FMEA), and [[Advance Product Quality Planning]] (APQP).\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n=== Journals ===\n* [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/15634/home The Quality Assurance Journal], ISSN: 1087-8378, [[John Wiley & Sons]]\n* [http://www.asq.org/qualityprogress/index.html QP - Quality Progress magazine], Published by the [[American Society for Quality]]\n* [http://www.emeraldinsight.com/products/journals/journals.htm?id=qae Quality Assurance in Education], ISSN 0968-4883, [[Emerald Publishing Group]]\n* [http://www.springerlink.com/content/q922ehvpaq49pw6q/ Accreditation and Quality Assurance: Journal for Quality, Comparability and Reliability in Chemical Measurement], ISSN: 0949-1775 Print, ISSN: 1432-0517\n* [http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/405859/description Food Quality and Preference], ISSN: 0950-3293\n\n=== Issues ===\n*Almeida, E., Alvaro, A., Meria, S.

This relatively new scientific field investigates the relationship between the structure of materials at atomic or molecular scales and their [[macroscopic]] properties. It incorporates elements of [[applied physics]] and [[chemistry]], with significant media attention focused on [[Nano science]] and [[nanotechnology]]. In recent years, materials science is becoming more widely known as a specific field of science and engineering.  It is an important part of [[forensic engineering]] (Forensic engineering is the investigation of materials, products, structures or components that fail or do not operate or function as intended, causing personal injury or damage to property.) and [[failure analysis]], the latter being the key to understanding, for example, the cause of various aviation accidents. Many of the most pressing scientific problems that are faced today are due to the limitations of the materials that are available and, as a result, breakthroughs in this field are likely to have a significant impact on the future of technology.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of materials science}}\nThe material of choice of a given era is often a defining point. Phrases such as [[Stone Age]], [[Bronze Age]], [[Iron Age]], and [[Industrial Revolution|Steel Age]] are great examples. Originally deriving from the manufacture of [[ceramic]]s and its putative derivative metallurgy, materials science is one of the oldest forms of engineering and applied science. Modern materials science evolved directly from [[metallurgy]], which itself evolved from mining and (likely) ceramics and the use of fire. A major breakthrough in the understanding of materials occurred in the late 19th century, when the American scientist [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] demonstrated that the [[thermodynamic]] properties related to [[atom|atomic structure]] in various [[phase (matter)|phases]] are related to the physical properties of a material. Important elements of modern materials science are a product of the [[space race]]: the understanding and [[engineering]] of the metallic [[alloys]], and [[silica]] and [[carbon]] materials, used in the construction of space vehicles enabling the exploration of space. Materials science has driven, and been driven by, the development of revolutionary technologies such as [[plastics]], [[semiconductors]], and [[biomaterials]].\n\nBefore the 1960s (and in some cases decades after), many ''materials science'' departments were named ''metallurgy'' departments, from a 19th and early 20th century emphasis on metals. The field has since broadened to include every class of materials, including [[Ceramic engineering|ceramics]], [[polymers]], [[semiconductors]], [[magnetism|magnetic materials]], [[medical implant]] materials, biological materials and nanomaterials ([[materiomics]]).\n\n==Fundamentals==\nThe basis of materials science involves relating the desired [[physical property|properties]] and relative performance of a material in a certain application to the structure of the atoms and phases in that material through characterization. The major determinants of the structure of a material and thus of its properties are its constituent chemical elements and the way in which it has been processed into its final form. These characteristics, taken together and related through the laws of [[thermodynamics]], govern a material\u2019s [[microstructure]], and thus its properties.\n\nThe manufacture of a perfect [[crystal]] of a material is physically impossible. Instead materials scientists manipulate the [[crystallographic defect|defects]] in crystalline materials such as [[precipitates]], grain boundaries ([[Hall\u2013Petch|Hall\u2013Petch relationship]]), interstitial atoms, vacancies or substitutional atoms, to create materials with the desired properties.\n\nNot all materials have a regular crystal structure. [[Polymers]] display varying degrees of crystallinity, and many are completely non-crystalline. [[Glass]] as, some ceramics, and many natural materials are [[Amorphous solid|amorphous]], not possessing any long-range order in their atomic arrangements. The study of polymers combines elements of chemical and statistical thermodynamics to give thermodynamic, as well as mechanical, descriptions of physical properties.\n\nIn addition to industrial interest, materials science has gradually developed into a field which provides tests for [[Condensed matter physics|condensed matter]] or [[Solid-state physics|solid state]] theories. New physics emerge because of the diverse new material properties that need to be explained.\n\n==Materials in industry==\nRadical [[Timeline of materials technology|materials advances]] can drive the creation of new products or even new industries, but stable industries also employ materials scientists to make incremental improvements and troubleshoot issues with currently used materials. Industrial applications of materials science include materials design, cost-benefit tradeoffs in industrial production of materials, processing techniques ([[casting]], [[rolling]], [[welding]], [[ion implantation]], [[crystal growth]], [[thin-film deposition]], [[sintering]], [[glassblowing]], etc.), and analytical techniques (characterization techniques such as [[electron microscopy]], [[x-ray diffraction]], [[calorimetry]], [[nuclear microscopy (HEFIB)]], [[Rutherford backscattering]], [[neutron diffraction]], small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), etc.).\n\nBesides material characterization, the material scientist/engineer also deals with the extraction of materials and their conversion into useful forms. Thus ingot casting, foundry techniques, blast furnace extraction, and electrolytic extraction are all part of the required knowledge of a metallurgist/engineer. Often the presence, absence or variation of minute quantities of secondary elements and compounds in a bulk material will have a great impact on the final properties of the materials produced, for instance, steels are classified based on 1/10 and 1/100 weight percentages of the carbon and other alloying elements they contain. Thus, the extraction and purification techniques employed in the extraction of iron in the blast furnace will have an impact of the quality of steel that may be produced.\n\nThe overlap between physics and materials science has led to the offshoot field of ''materials physics'', which is concerned with the physical properties of materials. The approach is generally more macroscopic and applied than in [[condensed matter physics]]. See [[list of publications in physics#Materials physics|important publications in materials physics]] for more details on this field of study.\n\n===Ceramics and glasses===\n[[Image:Si3N4bearings.jpg|thumb|200px|Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> ceramic bearing parts]]\nAnother application of the material sciences is the structures of [[glass]] and [[ceramic materials|ceramics]], typically associated with the most brittle materials. Bonding in ceramics and glasses use covalent and ionic-covalent types with SiO<sub>2</sub> (silica or sand) as a fundamental building block. Ceramics are as soft as clay and as hard as stone and concrete. Usually, they are crystalline in form. Most glasses contain a metal oxide fused with silica. At high temperatures used to prepare glass, the material is a viscous liquid. The structure of glass forms into an amorphous state upon cooling. Windowpanes and eyeglasses are important examples. Fibers of glass are also available. Scratch resistant Corning [[Gorilla Glass]] is a well-known example of the application of materials science to drastically improve the properties of common components. Diamond and carbon in its graphite form are considered to be ceramics.\n\nEngineering ceramics are known for their stiffness and stability under high temperatures, compression and electrical stress. Alumina, [[silicon carbide]], and [[tungsten carbide]] are made from a fine powder of their constituents in a process of sintering with a binder. Hot pressing provides higher density material. Chemical vapor deposition can place a film of a ceramic on another material. Cermets are ceramic particles containing some metals. The wear resistance of tools is derived from cemented carbides with the metal phase of cobalt and nickel typically added to modify properties.\n\n===Composite materials===\n[[File:Cfaser haarrp.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A 6 \u03bcm diameter carbon filament (running from bottom left to top right) siting atop the much larger human hair.]] [[Fiber|Filaments]] are commonly used for reinforcement in [[composite materials]].\nAnother application of material science in industry is the making of [[composite materials]]. Composite materials are structured materials composed of two or more macroscopic phases. Applications range from structural elements such as steel-reinforced concrete, to the thermally insulative tiles which play a key and integral role in NASA's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system]] which is used to protect the surface of the shuttle from the heat of re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. One example is [[reinforced Carbon-Carbon]] (RCC), the light gray material which withstands re-entry temperatures up to 1510 \u00b0C (2750 \u00b0F) and protects the Space Shuttle's wing leading edges and nose cap. RCC is a laminated composite material made from [[graphite]] [[rayon]] cloth and impregnated with a [[phenolic resin]]. After curing at high temperature in an autoclave, the laminate is pyrolized to convert the resin to carbon, impregnated with furfural alcohol in a vacuum chamber, and cured/pyrolized to convert the [[furfural]] alcohol to carbon. In order to provide oxidation resistance for reuse capability, the outer layers of the RCC are converted to [[silicon carbide]].\n\nOther examples can be seen in the \"plastic\" casings of television sets, cell-phones and so on. These plastic casings are usually a [[composite material]] made up of a thermoplastic matrix such as [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene]] (ABS) in which [[calcium carbonate]] chalk, [[talc]], [[glass fiber]]s or [[carbon fiber]]s have been added for added strength, bulk, or electrostatic dispersion. These additions may be referred to as reinforcing fibers, or dispersants, depending on their purpose.\n\n===Polymers===\n[[Image:ADN animation.gif|thumb|200px|right|Microstructure of part of a DNA double helix [[biopolymer]].]]\n\n[[Polymer]]s are also an important part of materials science. Polymers are the raw materials (the resins) used to make what we commonly call plastics. Plastics are really the final product, created after one or more polymers or additives have been added to a resin during processing, which is then shaped into a final form. Polymers which have been around, and which are in current widespread use, include [[polyethylene]], [[polypropylene]], [[PVC]], [[polystyrene]], [[nylon]]s, [[polyester]]s, [[acrylic resin|acrylics]], [[polyurethane]]s, and [[polycarbonate]]s. Plastics are generally classified as \"commodity\", \"specialty\" and \"engineering\" plastics.\n\nPVC (polyvinyl-chloride) is widely used, inexpensive, and annual production quantities are large. It lends itself to an incredible array of applications, from [[artificial leather]] to [[electrical insulation]] and cabling, [[packaging]] and [[Food storage|containers]]. Its fabrication and processing are simple and well-established. The versatility of PVC is due to the wide range of [[plasticiser]]s and other additives that it accepts. The term \"additives\" in polymer science refers to the chemicals and compounds added to the polymer base to modify its material properties.\n\n[[Polycarbonate]] would be normally considered an engineering plastic (other examples include PEEK, ABS). Engineering plastics are valued for their superior strengths and other special material properties. They are usually not used for disposable applications, unlike commodity plastics.\n\nSpecialty plastics are materials with unique characteristics, such as ultra-high strength, electrical conductivity, electro-fluorescence, high thermal stability, etc.\n\nThe dividing lines between the various types of plastics is not based on material but rather on their properties and applications. For instance, [[polyethylene]] (PE) is a cheap, low friction polymer commonly used to make disposable shopping bags and trash bags, and is considered a commodity plastic, whereas [[medium-density polyethylene]] (MDPE) is used for underground gas and water pipes, and another variety called Ultra-high Molecular Weight Polyethylene [[UHMWPE]] is an engineering plastic which is used extensively as the glide rails for industrial equipment and the low-friction socket in implanted [[hip joint]]s.\n\n===Metal alloys===\nThe study of metal alloys is a significant part of materials science. Of all the metallic alloys in use today, the alloys of iron ([[steel]], [[stainless steel]], [[cast iron]], [[tool steel]], [[alloy steel]]s) make up the largest proportion both by quantity and commercial value. Iron alloyed with various proportions of carbon gives low, mid and [[high carbon steel]]s. An iron carbon alloy is only considered steel if the carbon level is between 0.01% and 2.00%. For the steels, the [[hardness]] and tensile strength of the steel is related to the amount of carbon present, with increasing carbon levels also leading to lower ductility and toughness. Heat treatment processes such as quenching and tempering can significantly change these properties however. Cast Iron is defined as an iron\u2013carbon alloy with more than 2.00% but less than 6.67% carbon. Stainless steel is defined as a regular steel alloy with greater than 10% by weight alloying content of Chromium. Nickel and Molybdenum are typically also found in stainless steels.\n\nOther significant metallic alloys are those of [[aluminium]], [[titanium]], [[copper]] and [[magnesium]]. [[Copper alloys]] have been known for a long time (since the [[Bronze Age]]), while the alloys of the other three metals have been relatively recently developed. Due to the chemical reactivity of these metals, the electrolytic extraction processes required were only developed relatively recently. The alloys of aluminium, titanium and magnesium are also known and valued for their high strength-to-weight ratios and, in the case of magnesium, their ability to provide electromagnetic shielding. These materials are ideal for situations where high strength-to-weight ratios are more important than bulk cost, such as in the aerospace industry and certain automotive engineering applications.\n\n==Sub-disciplines of materials science==\n\nBelow is a list of disciplines within or related to the materials science field.  These range from biomaterials, to ceramics, to metals, to textile reinforced materials.

The term welder refers to the operator, the machine is referred to as the [[welding power supply]]. The materials to be joined can be [[metal]]s (such as [[steel]], [[aluminum]], [[brass]], [[stainless steel]] etc.) or varieties of [[plastic]] or [[polymer]]. Welders typically have to have good [[dexterity]] and attention to detail, as well as some technical knowledge about the materials being joined and best practices in the field.<ref>[[Lincoln Electric]] (1994).

However, with the use of new technology and proper protection, the risks of injury and death associated with welding can be greatly reduced. {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Because many common welding procedures involve an open electric arc or flame, the risk of burns is significant. To prevent them, welders wear [[personal protective equipment]] in the form of heavy [[leather]] [[glove]]s and protective long sleeve jackets to avoid exposure to extreme heat and flames. Additionally, the brightness of the weld area leads to a condition called [[arc eye]] in which [[ultraviolet light]] causes the inflammation of the [[cornea]] and can burn the [[retina]]s of the eyes. Full face [[welding helmet]]s with dark face plates are worn to prevent this exposure, and in recent years, new helmet models have been produced that feature a face plate that self-darkens upon exposure to high amounts of UV light. To protect bystanders, opaque welding curtains often surround the welding area. These curtains, made of a [[polyvinyl chloride]] plastic film, shield nearby workers from exposure to the UV light from the electric arc, but should not be used to replace the [[filter (optics)|filter]] glass used in helmets.<ref name=\"Cary\">Cary, Howard B. and Scott C.

Processes like flux-cored arc welding and shielded metal arc welding produce [[smoke]] containing particles of various types of [[oxide]]s, which in some cases can lead to medical conditions like [[metal fume fever]]. The size of the particles in question tends to influence the [[toxicity]] of the fumes, with smaller particles presenting greater danger. Additionally, many processes produce fumes and various gases, most commonly [[carbon dioxide]] and [[ozone]], that can prove dangerous if ventilation is inadequate. Furthermore, because the use of compressed gases and flames in many welding processes pose an explosion and fire risk, some common precautions include limiting the amount of [[oxygen]] in the air and keeping combustible materials away from the workplace.<ref name=\"Cary\"/> Welders with expertise in welding pressurized vessels, including submarine hulls, industrial boilers, and power plant heat exchangers and boilers, are generally referred to as [[boilermakers]].<ref>The International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders, Blacksmiths, Forgers and Helpers official website [http://www.boilermakers.org www.boilermakers.org]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Hyperbaric welding]]\n* [[Welder certification]]\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Commonscat|Welding}}\n*ASM International (2003).

Some processes have been completely automated.\n\nThe biggest benefit of automation is that it saves labor, however, it is also used to save energy and materials and to improve quality, accuracy and precision.\n\nThe term ''automation'', inspired by the earlier word ''[[wikt:automatic|automatic]]'' (coming from ''[[automaton]]''), was not widely used before 1947, when General Motors established the automation department.<ref name=\"Rifkin 1995\">{{cite book| author = Rifkin, Jeremy | title = The End of Work: The Decline of the Global Labor Force and the Dawn of the Post-Market Era | publisher = Putnam Publishing Group | year = 1995 | isbn = 0-87477-779-8|pages=66, 75}}</ref>  It was during this time that industry was rapidly adopting [[PID controller|feedback controllers]], which were introduced in the 1930s.<ref>{{cite book\n|title=A History of Control Engineering 1930-1955\n |last=Bennett\n |first= S. \n|authorlink= \n|year=1993 |publisher =Peter Peregrinus Ltd.

Complicated systems, such as modern factories, airplanes and ships typically use all these combined techniques.\n\n==Types of automation==\n{{Main|Control system}}\nTwo common types of automation are feedback control, which is usually continuous and involves taking measurements using a sensor and making calculated adjustments to keep the measured variable within a set range, and sequence control, in which a programmed sequence of discrete operations is performed, often based on system logic.  Cruise control is an example of the former while an elevator or an automated teller machine (ATM) is an example of the latter.\n\nThe theoretical basis of feedback control is [[control theory]], which also covers [[servomechanisms]], which are often part of an automated system.\nFeedback control is called \"closed loop\" while non-feedback control is called \"open loop.\"\n===Feedback control===\nFeedback control is accomplished with a [[controller (control theory)|controller]]. To function properly, a controller must provide correction in a manner that maintains stability.  Maintaining stability is a principal objective of control theory.\n\nAs an example of feedback control, consider a steam coil air heater in which a temperature sensor measures the temperature of the heated air, which is the measured variable.  This signal is constantly \"fed back\" to the controller, which compares it to the desired setting (set point).  The controller calculates the difference (error), then calculates a correction and sends the correction signal to adjust the air pressure to a diaphragm that moves a positioner on the steam valve, opening or closing it by the calculated amount. All the elements constituting the measurement and control of a single variable are called a ''control loop''.\n\nThe complexities of this are that the quantities involved are all of different physical types; the temperature sensor signal may be electrical or pressure from an enclosed fluid, the controller may employ pneumatic, hydraulic, mechanical or electronic techniques to sense the error and send a signal to adjust the air pressure that moves the valve.\n\nThe first controllers used [[analog device|analog]] methods to perform their calculations.  Analog methods were also used in solving differential equations of control theory.  The electronic [[analog computer]] was developed to solve control type problems and electronic analog controllers were also developed.<ref name=\"Bennett 1993 pp\">{{Harvnb|Bennett|1993|pp=}}</ref>  Analog computers were displaced by digital computers when they became widely available.\n\nCommon applications of feedback control are control of temperature, pressure, flow, and speed.\n\n===Sequential control and logical sequence control===\nSequential control may be either to a fixed sequence or to a logical one that will perform different actions depending on various system states. An example of an adjustable but otherwise fixed sequence is a timer on a lawn sprinkler. An elevator is an example that uses logic based on the system states to perform certain actions in response to operator input.  \n\nA development of sequential control was [[relay logic]], by which electrical relays engage electrical contacts which either start or interrupt power to a device. Relays were first used in telegraph networks before being developed for controlling other devices, such as when starting and stopping industrial-sized electric motors or opening and closing solenoid valves. Using relays for control purposes allowed event-driven control, where actions could be triggered out of sequence, in response to external events. These were more flexible in their response than the rigid single-sequence cam timers. More complicated examples involved maintaining safe sequences for devices such as swing bridge controls, where a lock bolt needed to be disengaged before the bridge could be moved, and the lock bolt could not be released until the safety gates had already been closed. \n\nThe total number of relays, cam timers and drum sequencers can number into the hundreds or even thousands in some factories. Early [[computer programming|programming]] techniques and languages were needed to make such systems manageable, one of the first being [[ladder logic]], where diagrams of the interconnected relays resembled the rungs of a ladder. Special computers called [[programmable logic controllers]] were later designed to replace these collections of hardware with a single, more easily re-programmed unit. \n  \nIn a typical hard wired motor start and stop circuit (called a ''control circuit'') a motor is started by pushing a \"Start\" or \"Run\" button that activates a pair of electrical relays.  The \"lock-in\" relay locks in contacts that keep the control circuit energized when the push button is released.  (The start button is a normally open contact and the stop button is normally closed contact.)  Another relay energizes a switch that powers the device that throws the motor starter switch (three sets of contacts for three phase industrial power) in the main power circuit. (Note: Large motors use high voltage and experience high in-rush current, making speed important in making and breaking contact.  This can be dangerous for personnel and property with manual switches.)  All contacts are held engaged by their respective electromagnets until a \"stop\" or \"off\" button is pressed, which de-energizes the lock in relay.  See diagram: [http://www.exman.com/mshoass.html Motor Starters Hand-Off-Auto With Start-Stop] (Note: The above description is the \"Auto\" position case in this diagram).\n\nCommonly [[interlock (engineering)|interlock]]s are added to a control circuit.  Suppose that the motor in the example is powering machinery that has a critical need for lubrication.  In this case an interlock could be added to insure that the oil pump is running before the motor starts.  Timers, limit switches and electric eyes are other common elements in control circuits.\n\n[[Solenoid valve]]s are widely used on compressed air or hydraulic fluid for powering [[actuator]]s on mechanical components.  While motors are used to supply continuous rotary motion, actuators are typically a better choice for intermittently creating a limited range of movement for a mechanical component, such as moving various mechanical arms, opening or closing valves, raising heavy press rolls, applying pressure to presses.\n\n===Computer control===\nComputers can perform both sequential control and feedback control, and typically a single computer will do both in an industrial application.  [[Programmable logic controller]]s (PLCs) are a type of special purpose  microprocessor that replaced many hardware components such as timers and drum sequencers used in [[relay logic]].  General purpose process control computers have increasingly replaced stand alone controllers, with a single computer able to perform the operations of hundreds of controllers.  Process control computers can process data from a network of PLCs, instruments and controllers in order to implement typical (such as [[PID controller|PID]]) control of many individual variables or, in some cases, to implement complex control [[algorithm]]s using multiple inputs and mathematical manipulations.  They can also analyze data and create real time graphical displays for operators and run reports for engineers and management.\n\nControl of an [[automated teller machine]] (ATM) is an example of an interactive process in which a computer will perform a logic derived response to a user selection based on information retrieved from a networked database.  The ATM process has a lot of similarities to other online transaction processes.  The different logical responses are called ''scenarios''.  Such processes are typically designed with the aid of [[use case]]s and [[flowchart]]s, which guide the writing of the software code.\n\n==History== \nThe earliest feedback control mechanisms was used to tent the sails of windmills.  It was patented by Edmund Lee in 1745.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bennett|1979|pp=}}</ref>\n\nThe [[centrifugal governor]], which dates to the last quarter of the 18th century, was used to adjust the gap between [[millstone]]s.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|title=A History of Control Engineering 1800-1930\n |last1=Bennett\n |first1= S.  \n|year=1979 |publisher =Peter Peregrinus Ltd.\n|location= London\n|isbn= 0-86341-047-2|pages=47, 266\n| postscript = <!--None-->}}\n</ref>   The centrifugal governor was also used in the automatic flour mill developed by [[Oliver Evans]] in 1785, making it the first completely automated industrial process.\nThe governor was adopted by James Watt for use on a steam engine in 1788 after Watt\u2019s partner Boulton saw one at a flour mill [[Boulton & Watt]] were building.<ref name=\"Bennett 1979 pp\">{{Harvnb|Bennett|1979|pp=}}</ref>\n\nThe governor could not actually hold a set speed; the engine would assume a new constant speed in response to load changes.  The governor was able to handle smaller variations such as those caused by fluctuating heat load to the boiler.  Also, there was a tendency for oscillation whenever there was a speed change.   As a consequence, engines equipped with this governor were not suitable for operations requiring constant speed, such as cotton spinning.<ref name=\"Bennett 1979 pp\"/>\n\nSeveral improvements to the governor, plus improvements to valve cut-off timing on the steam engine, made the engine suitable for most industrial uses before the end of the 19th century.  Advances in the steam engine stayed well ahead of science, both thermodynamics and control theory.<ref name=\"Bennett 1979 pp\"/>\n\nThe governor received relatively little scientific attention until [[James Clerk Maxwell]] published a paper that established the beginning of a theoretical basis for understanding control theory. Development of the electronic amplifier during the 1920s, which was important for long distance telephony, required a higher signal to noise ratio, which was solved by negative feedback noise cancellation.  This and other telephony applications contributed to control theory.  Military applications during the Second World War that contributed to and benefited from control theory were [[fire-control system]]s and aircraft controls.  The so-called classical theoretical treatment of control theory dates to the 1940s and 1950s.<ref name=\"Bennett 1993 pp\"/>\n\n[[Relay logic]] was introduced with factory [[electrification]], which underwent rapid adaption from 1900 though the 1920s.  Central electric power stations were also undergoing rapid growth and operation of new high pressure boilers, steam turbines and electrical substations created a large demand for instruments and controls.\n\nCentral control rooms became common in the 1920s, but as late as the early 1930s, most process control was on-off.  Operators typically monitored charts drawn by recorders that plotted data from instruments.  To make corrections, operators manually opened or closed valves or turned switches on or off.  Control rooms also used color coded lights to send signals to workers in the plant to manually make certain changes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bennett|1993|pp=31}}</ref>\n\nControllers, which were able to make calculated changes in response to deviations from a set point rather than on-off control, began being introduced the 1930s.  Controllers allowed manufacturing to continue showing productivity gains to offset the declining influence of factory electrification.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|title=A Great Leap Forward: 1930s Depression and U.S. Economic Growth\n |last=Field\n |first= Alexander J.\n|authorlink= \n|year= 2011 |publisher =Yale University Press\n|location= New Haven, London\n|isbn=978-0-300-15109-1 |pages=\n| postscript = <Factory productivity was greatly increased by electrification in the 1920s.

This soon evolved into computerized numerical control (CNC).\n\nToday extensive automation is practiced in practically type of manufacturing and assembly process.  Some of the larger processes include electrical power generation, oil refining, chemicals, steel mills, plastics, cement plants, fertilizer plants, pulp and paper mills, automobile and truck assembly, aircraft production, glass manufacturing, natural gas separation plants, food and beverage processing, canning and bottling and manufacture of various kinds of parts.  Robots are especially useful in hazardous applications like automobile spray painting.  Robots are also used to assemble electronic circuit boards.  Automotive welding is done with robots and automatic welders are used in applications like pipelines.\n\n== Advantages and disadvantages ==\n\n{{procon|date=November 2012}}\n\nThe main advantages of automation are:\n*Increased through output or productivity.\n*Improved quality or increased predictability of quality.\n*Improved robustness (consistency), of processes or product.\n*Increased consistency of output.\n*Reduced direct human labor costs and expenses.\n\nThe following methods are often employed to improve productivity, quality, or robustness.\n*Install automation in operations to reduce cycle time.\n*Install automation where a high degree of accuracy is required.\n*Replacing human operators in tasks that involve hard physical or monotonous work.<ref>[http://www.bma-automation.com/Prozessautomatisierung.2102.0.html?id=2102&L=1 Process automation, retrieved on 20.02.2010]</ref>\n*Replacing humans in tasks done in dangerous environments (i.e. fire, space, volcanoes, nuclear facilities, underwater, etc.)\n*Performing tasks that are beyond human capabilities of size, weight, speed, endurance, etc.\n*Economic improvement: Automation may improve in economy of enterprises, society or most of humanity. For example, when an enterprise invests in automation, technology recovers its investment; or when a state or country increases its income due to automation like [[Germany]] or [[Japan]] in the 20th Century.\n*Reduces operation time and work handling time significantly.\n*Frees up workers to take on other roles.\n*Provides higher level jobs in the development, deployment, maintenance and running of the automated processes.\n\nThe main disadvantages of automation are:\n\n*Causing [[unemployment]] and [[poverty]] by replacing human labor.\n*Security Threats/Vulnerability: An automated system may have a limited level of intelligence, and is therefore more susceptible to committing errors outside of its immediate scope of knowledge (e.g., it is typically unable to apply the rules of simple logic to general propositions).\n*Unpredictable/excessive development costs: The [[research and development]] cost of automating a process may exceed the cost saved by the automation itself.\n*High initial cost: The automation of a new [[Product (business)|product]] or [[plant]] typically requires a very large initial investment in comparison with the unit cost of the product, although the cost of automation may be spread among many products and over time.\n\nIn manufacturing, the purpose of automation has shifted to issues broader than productivity, cost, and time.\n\n==Lights out manufacturing==\n\n{{Main|Lights out (manufacturing)}}\nLights out manufacturing is when a production system is 100% or near to 100% automated (not hiring any workers). In order to eliminate the need for labor costs all together.\n\n==Health and environment==\n\nThe costs of automation to the environment are different depending on the technology, product or engine automated. There are automated engines that consume more energy resources from the Earth in comparison with previous engines and those that do the opposite{{clarify|date=October 2013}} too.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Hazardous operations, such as [[oil refining]], the manufacturing of [[Chemical industry|industrial chemicals]], and all forms of [[metal working]], were always early contenders for automation.{{dubious|date=October 2013}}{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n==Convertibility and turnaround time==\n\nAnother major shift in automation is the increased demand for flexibility and convertibility in manufacturing processes. Manufacturers are increasingly demanding the ability to easily switch from manufacturing Product A to manufacturing Product B without having to completely rebuild the [[production line]]s. Flexibility and distributed processes have led to the introduction of [[Automated Guided Vehicle]]s with Natural Features Navigation.\n\nDigital electronics helped too. Former analogue-based instrumentation was replaced by digital equivalents which can be more accurate and flexible, and offer greater scope for more sophisticated configuration, parametrization and operation. This was accompanied by the [[fieldbus]] revolution which provided a networked (i.e. a single cable) means of communicating between control systems and field level instrumentation, eliminating hard-wiring.\n\nDiscrete manufacturing plants adopted these technologies fast. The more conservative process industries with their longer plant life cycles have been slower to adopt and analogue-based measurement and control still dominates. The growing use of [[Industrial Ethernet]] on the factory floor is pushing these trends still further, enabling manufacturing plants to be integrated more tightly within the enterprise, via the internet if necessary. Global competition has also increased demand for [[Reconfigurable Manufacturing System]]s.\n\n==Automation tools==\nEngineers can now have [[numerical control]] over automated devices. The result has been a rapidly expanding range of applications and human activities. [[Computer-aided technologies]] (or CAx) now serve the basis for mathematical and organizational tools used to create complex systems. Notable examples of CAx include [[Computer-aided design]] (CAD software) and [[Computer-aided manufacturing]] (CAM software). The improved design, analysis, and manufacture of products enabled by CAx has been beneficial for industry.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6TYR-4C62R0B-2&_user=10&_coverDate=12%2F31%2F2004&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=browse&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=cc7a4e3e1cfdc05c7556848feaecf169|title=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6TYR-4C62R0B-2&_user=10&_coverDate=12%2F31%2F2004&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=browse&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=cc7a4e3e1cfdc05c7556848feaecf169\n|title=Engineers' CAx education\u2014it's not only CAD}}</ref>\n\n[[Information technology]], together with [[industry|industrial]] [[machinery]] and [[industrial process|process]]es, can assist in the design, implementation, and monitoring of control systems. One example of an [[industrial control systems|industrial control system]] is a [[programmable logic controller]] (PLC). PLCs are specialized hardened computers which are frequently used to synchronize the flow of inputs from (physical) [[sensor]]s and events with the flow of outputs to actuators and events.<ref name=\"Reference.com\">\n{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Automation|title=Automation - Definitions from Dictionary.com|publisher=dictionary.reference.com|accessdate=2008-04-22| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080429002933/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/automation| archivedate= 29 April 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Automated online assistant.png|thumb|An [[automated online assistant]] on a website, with an [[avatar (computing)|avatar]] for enhanced [[human\u2013computer interaction]].]]\n[[Human-computer interaction|Human-machine interface]]s (HMI) or [[Human\u2013computer interaction|computer human interfaces]] (CHI), formerly known as ''man-machine interfaces'', are usually employed to communicate with PLCs and other computers. Service personnel who monitor and control through HMIs can be called by different names. In industrial process and manufacturing environments, they are called operators or something similar. In boiler houses and central utilities departments they are called stationary engineers.<ref>[http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos228.htm Stationary Engineers and Boiler Operators<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nDifferent types of automation tools exist:\n* ANN - [[Artificial neural network]]\n* DCS - [[Distributed Control System]]\n* HMI - [[Human Machine Interface]]\n* SCADA - [[Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition]]\n* PLC - [[Programmable Logic Controller]]\n* [[Instrumentation]]\n* [[Motion control]]\n* [[Robotics]]\n\n===Limitations to automation===\n*Current technology is unable to automate all the desired tasks.\n*Many operations using automation have large amounts of invested capital and produce high volumes of product, making malfunctions extremely costly and potentially hazardous.  Therefore, some personnel are needed to insure that the entire system functions properly and that safety and product quality are maintained.\n*As a process becomes increasingly automated, there is less and less labor to be saved or quality improvement to be gained.  This is an example of both [[diminishing returns]] and the [[logistic function]].\n*As more and more processes become automated, there are fewer remaining non-automated processes.  This is an example of exhaustion of opportunities. New technological paradigms may however set new limits that surpass the previous limits.\n\n===Current limitations===\nMany roles for humans in industrial processes presently lie beyond the scope of automation. Human-level [[pattern recognition]], [[language comprehension]], and language production ability are well beyond the capabilities of modern mechanical and computer systems. Tasks requiring subjective assessment or synthesis of complex sensory data, such as scents and sounds, as well as high-level tasks such as strategic planning, currently require human expertise. In many cases, the use of humans is more cost-effective than mechanical approaches even where automation of industrial tasks is possible. Overcoming these obstacles is a theorized path to [[post-scarcity]] economics.\n\n==Recent and emerging applications==\n{{expand section|date=April 2011}}\n[[File:Factory Automation Robotics Palettizing Bread.jpg|thumb|[[KUKA]] [[industrial robot]]s being used at a bakery for food production]]\n\n===Automated retail===\n\n'''Food and drink'''\n{{Main|Automated restaurant}}\nThe food retail industry has started to apply automation to the ordering process; [[McDonald's]] has introduced touch screen ordering and payment systems in many of its restaurants, reducing the need for as many cashier employees.<ref>[http://blogs.itbusiness.ca/2011/05/mcdonald%E2%80%99s-automation-a-sign-of-declining-service-sector-employment/]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}</ref> [[University of Texas]] has introduced fully automated cafe retail locations.<ref>[http://singularityhub.com/2012/05/09/automation-comes-to-the-coffeehouse-with-robotic-baristas/ Automation Comes To The Coffeehouse With Robotic Baristas].

Currently, there is a major effort underway in the vision community to develop a fully automated [[Space Tracking and Surveillance System|tracking surveillance]] system. Automated video surveillance monitors people and vehicles in real time within a busy environment. Existing automated surveillance systems are based on the environment they are primarily designed to observe, i.e., indoor, outdoor or airborne, the amount of sensors that the automated system can handle and the mobility of sensor, i.e., stationary camera vs. mobile camera. The purpose of a surveillance system is to record properties and trajectories of objects in a given area, generate warnings or notify designated authority in case of occurrence of particular events.<ref>Javed, O, & Shah, M. (2008). Automated multi-camera surveillance. City of Publication: Springer-Verlag New York Inc.</ref>\n\n===Automated highway systems===\n{{main|Automated highway systems}}\n\nAs demands for safety and mobility have grown and technological possibilities have multiplied, interest in automation has grown. Seeking to accelerate the development and introduction of fully automated vehicles and highways, the [[United States Congress]] authorized more than $650 million over six years for [[intelligent transport system]]s (ITS) and demonstration projects in the 1991 [[Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act]] (ISTEA). Congress legislated in ISTEA that \u201cthe [[United States Secretary of Transportation|Secretary of Transportation]] shall develop an automated highway and vehicle prototype from which future fully automated intelligent vehicle-highway systems can be developed. Such development shall include research in human factors to ensure the success of the man-machine relationship. The goal of this program is to have the first fully automated highway roadway or an automated test track in operation by 1997. This system shall accommodate installation of equipment in new and existing motor vehicles.\" [ISTEA 1991, part B, Section 6054(b)].\n\nFull automation commonly defined as requiring no control or very limited control by the driver; such automation would be accomplished through a combination of sensor, computer, and communications systems in vehicles and along the roadway. Fully automated driving would, in theory, allow closer vehicle spacing and higher speeds, which could enhance traffic capacity in places where additional road building is physically impossible, politically unacceptable, or prohibitively expensive. Automated controls also might enhance road safety by reducing the opportunity for driver error, which causes a large share of motor vehicle crashes. Other potential benefits include improved air quality (as a result of more-efficient traffic flows), increased fuel economy, and spin-off technologies generated during research and development related to automated highway systems.<ref>Menzies, Thomas.

There are two basic types: desktop automation and automated voice solutions. Desktop automation refers to software programming that makes it easier for the call center agent to work across multiple desktop tools. The automation would take the information entered into one tool and populate it across the others so it did not have to be entered more than once, for example. Automated voice solutions allow the agents to remain on the line while disclosures and other important information is provided to customers in the form of pre-recorded audio files. Specialized applications of these automated voice solutions enable the agents to process credit cards without ever seeing or hearing the credit card numbers or CVV codes<ref name=\"adsit\">{{cite news | last=Adsit | first=Dennis| url= http://www.isixsigma.com/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=1854&Itemid=1&Itemid=1| title= Error-proofing strategies for managing call center fraud | work= isixsigma.com |date= February 21, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe key benefit of agent-assisted automation is compliance and error-proofing.

Pipefitters usually begin as helpers or apprentices. Journeyman pipefitters deal with industrial/commercial/marine piping and heating/cooling systems. Typical industrial process pipe is under high pressure, which requires metals such as [[carbon steel]], [[stainless steel]], and many different alloy metals fused together through precise cutting, threading, grooving (Victaulic), bending and [[welding]]. A plumber concentrates on lower pressure piping systems for sewage and potable water (tap water), in the industrial, commercial, institutional, or residential atmosphere. Utility piping typically consists of copper, [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]], [[Chlorinated polyvinyl chloride|CPVC]], [[polyethylene]], and [[galvanized pipe]], which is typically glued, [[Soldering|soldered]], or [[threaded pipe|threaded]]. Other types of piping systems include steam, ventilation, hydraulics, chemicals, fuel, and oil.<ref>https://tradesecrets.alberta.ca/trades-occupations/profiles/0074/ Steamfitter/Pipefitter Trade Profile. Alberta Trade Secrets. 1995-2010.</ref>\n\nIn the United States, many states require pipefitters to be licensed. Requirements differ from state to state, but most include a four- to five-year apprenticeship. Union pipefitters are required to pass an apprenticeship test (often called a \"turn-out exam\") before becoming a licensed journeyman.

The 1st\u00a0century BC engineer [[Vitruvius]] writes in detail about laborer practices at that time. In his experience a good crew of laborers is just as valuable as any other aspect of construction. Other than the addition of [[pneumatic]]s, laborer practices have changed little. With the advent of advanced technology and its introduction into the construction field, the laborers have been quick to include much of this technology as being laborers work.\n\n==Tools and equipment==\n[[File:Vladimir Putin 22 March 2002-4.jpg|thumb|[[Vladimir Putin]] (left) and Underground laborers]]\n\nThe following tools are considered a minimum: [[hammer]], [[Diagonal pliers|pliers w/ side-cutters]], [[utility knife]], [[tape measure]], locking pliers, [[Adjustable spanner|crescent wrench]], [[screwdriver]], [[masonry trowel|margin trowel]], [[carpenter's pencil]] or [[soapstone]], tool belt and one pouch (bag). In addition: a [[five gallon bucket]] with additional tools, [[All-purpose Lightweight Individual Carrying Equipment|toolbelt suspenders]], [[Canteen (bottle)|water jug]] and lunchbox are recommended. Most [[safety equipment]] that is consumed or work specific, for example [[hard hat]], [[safety glasses]], [[Hearing impairment#Long term exposure to environmental noise|hearing protection]], gloves, [[Safety harness|fall protection]], [[High-visibility clothing]], [[Wellington boot|concrete boots]], [[respirator]]/[[dust mask]] and [[Steel-toe boots|toe guards]]<ref>http://www.ellwoodsafety.com/foot_and_toe_guards.html</ref> are provided by the employer as part of [[construction site safety]]. Personal safety equipment, for example full leather boots (some long time laborers believe steel toes are dangerous on the construction site; it is better to have crushed toes than toes cut off by the crushed steel), high strength pants - [[Carhartt]] or [[jeans]] (some modify thighs with a sacrificial second layer of jean fabric cut from an old pair) - [[sock]]s, [[lip balm]], and climate specific [[outerwear]] (unless laborers are instructed to work in a climate different from what they typically reside in, for example high elevation), are provided by the individual.\n\n==Types of work==\n\nSome of the work done by laborers includes:'''<ref>Laborers' Local 185, Scope of Work, on the Internet at [http://www.laborerslocal185.com/scope_of_work.htm Laborers Local 185, Welcome Home] (visited May\u00a031,\u00a02008).</ref>\n\n*[[concrete]] - [[shotcrete]], [[gunite]], [[grouting]] and [[formwork|steel forms]]\n*[[demolition]] - [[concrete saw|concrete cutting]], pavement breaking, [[cutting torch]]\n*[[environmental remediation]] and [[hazardous waste]]\n*[[fence]]s and [[landscaping]]\n*[[hod carrier]] - [[masonry|block masonry]], [[plaster]]ers and [[fireproofing]]\n*[[Pavement (material)|paving]] - white paving formwork, [[Road traffic control|traffic control]], [[road surface marking|striping]], signs\n*[[piping]] - [[water pipe]], [[sanitary sewer|sewer]] and [[storm drain]]\n*field [[technology]]\n*[[tunnels]] - [[drilling]] and [[Rock blasting|blasting]]\n*[[utilities|dry utilities]] - [[electrical conduit]] and [[Electrical conduit|communications conduit]]\n\nMuch of the work traditionally claimed by laborers is merely work that did not fit into any other workforce's labor classification. These other [[list of construction trades|classifications]] (in order of prestige) typically include the [[heavy equipment operator]]s, [[ironworkers]], [[carpenter]]s, [[concrete finisher|masons]], [[teamsters]]/truck drivers and [[hod carrier]]s. In addition, work that typically was shunned by [[journeymen]] of other [[trade union]]s tradesman/craftsman or was given to their [[apprentices]] is generally done by laborers in the absence of apprentices.\n\nAn example is the operators who in the division of labor have all the equipment.  Most operators will not operate equipment they perceive as lowly such as [[skid steer]], [[Street sweeper|kick-brooms]] and [[telescopic handlers]], laborers usually are used to operate these unless an operator apprentice is available and demands his right to operate.  The same is true for most other trades except the ironworkers who are notorious for protecting their work and not wanting anyone else to touch their steel, tie-wire or [[Klein Tools|Kliens]].  The advantage to this system is that many laborers gain sufficient experience working with another trade to journeyman-in while earning a higher wage than an apprentice.  Many foremen will gradually give a laborer extra responsibility until they are performing at a journeyman level and can enter a more skilled union as a journeyman.\n\n==Pay==\nThe pay for a union laborer is equal or greater than most work available to anyone with a bachelor degree, making this one of the few fields where someone without a high school degree can still earn a [[living wage]]. Union, heavy construction and highway construction laborers earn on average (2008 US) $25.47/h compared to 13.72/h for non-union laborers.<ref>{{cite web |title=Better Jobs |url=http://www.liuna.org/BetterJobs/tabid/55/Default.aspx |publisher=Laborers' International Union of North America |accessdate=May 31, 2008}}</ref>  In addition to paid earnings, union laborers enjoy the benefits of medical insurance, vacation pay, pension plans, representation and vocational schools; totaling $45/hr (2012 US) and some with special skills earn 'over-rate' wages. It is not uncommon for young [[civil engineers]], [[construction management|construction managers]] and [[construction engineering|construction engineers]] to earn less than their apprentice laborers. However, unlike engineers, laborers are not usually employed full-time year round. The additional pay they receive is often balanced out by the lesser unemployment checks they receive while out of work. These unemployment checks supplement the winter pay laborers often earn as independent contractors and ''under-the-table'' work. On average young engineers earn (2007 US$) 40,000 to 60,000 while union laborers on average earn 50,000 to 80,000. Engineers are not immune to being out of work, in heavy civil work some are employed on a project basis. They are not guaranteed a place on any subsequent projects, though this is in practice often the case. The value of work put in place by laborers and the value of avoided rework and increased efficiencies produced by the engineers' planning is a balance of resource utilization on any large project. Union laborers earn more than [[unfree labour|unfree labor]] and can be an avenue for those who are uneducated and with no resources to become educated and with resources.\n\n==Hazards and conditions==\nThere are dangers accociated with laboring.  Many laborers are severely injured or killed by accident each year while performing work duties.  Many who work as laborers for even a short period of time will suffer from permanent work injuries such as: [[hearing loss]], [[arthritis]], [[osteoarthritis]], [[back injuries]], [[eye injury]], [[head injury]], [[chemical burn]] ([[Lime (mineral)|lime]] sensitivity), [[pneumoconiosis|lung disease]], missing finger nails and skin scars.  [[Alcoholism]], [[Performance enhancing drug|drug use]], and [[drug abuse]] are common although most companies require [[drug screening]] for all new hires.  If a laborer is injured on the job they are immediately given a drug test.  If the test results are positive then they are ineligible for any [[Workers' compensation]] benefits.  There is a gray area for the use of [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] due to [[medical marijuana]] prescriptions.  Some who have been dismissed for failing a drug test while possessing a prescription have been later reinstated with pay as having been [[Wrongful dismissal|wrongfully terminated]]. The Laborers' International Union of North America ([[LIUNA]]) represents laborers on public and private projects.  Some of the business representatives are laborers who have been so severely injured they can no longer labor. With a phone call and a good reason they will be on-site the next morning asking questions and demanding apologies for mistreatment of laborers.\n\nThis job, at times, and depending on who is in charge, qualifies for the [[Dirty, dangerous and demeaning|3D's]], '''D'''irty, [[Risk|'''D'''angerous]] and [[Demeaning|'''D'''emeaning]], or showing global connotation, as the Japanese say it ''[[wiktionary:\u6c5a\u3044|kitanai]]'', ''[[wiktionary:\u5371\u967a|kiken]]'', and ''[[wiktionary:\u304d\u3064\u3044|kitsui]].'' Many other times laboring is a very gratifying job with lots of fresh air ([[pneumoconiosis|jobsite air quality]]) and sunshine.  The sheer hardship, [[drudgery]] and physical demands of the job ensure that there is always a shortage of good laborers. But, mistakes can be made and laborers have been asked to go forward with ill-made plans.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Navvy]], particularly applied to describe the manual labourers working on British major civil engineering projects\n* [[Proletariat]], a Marxist category of laborers.\n\n==External links==\n;Organizations:\n*[http://www.laborerslocal185.com/ Laborers Local 185, Welcome Home]\n*[http://www.ncdc-laborers.org/ Northern California District Council of Laborers (NCDCL)]\n*[http://www.kleintools.com/ Klein Tools]\n*[http://www.liuna.org/ Laborers International Union of North America (LIUNA)]\n\n;Construction Engineering & Management Education:\n*[http://www.construction.calpoly.edu California Polytechnic State University]\n*[http://cm.csuchico.edu/ California State University]\n*[http://www.csus.edu/cm California State University, Sacramento]\n*[http://cem.stanford.edu/programs/construction/ Stanford University]\n\n;Occupational Outlook Handbook:\n*[http://www.bls.gov/oco/home.htm All occupations] at U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\n*[http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos248.htm Laborors] at U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\n*[http://www.careervoyages.gov/occupationdesc-acinet-results.cfm?streamingvideostring=Eng/47-2061.00&industry=construction&multipleyesno=no&soccode=472061&photoyesno=yes Career Voyages - Good Jobs, Better Pay, Brighter Future]\n*[http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm Wages, Earnings, and Benefits] at [[U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics]]\n*[http://www.hse.gov.uk/index.htm Health and Safety Executive]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Construction trades workers]]\n\n[[no:Bl\u00e5snipparbeider]]", "Tool and die maker": "{{distinguish|tap and die}}\n{{refimprove|date=September 2008}}\n\n'''Tool and die makers''' are a class of [[machinist]]s in the [[manufacturing|manufacturing industries]] who make [[Jig (tool)|jigs]], [[Fixture (tool)|fixtures]], [[die (manufacturing)|dies]], [[molding (process)|molds]], [[machine tool]]s, [[cutting tool (machining)|cutting tools]], [[gauge (instrument)|gauges]], and other tools used in manufacturing processes.<ref>[http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos225.htm Tool and die makers] by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, retrieved April 8, 2009</ref> Depending on which area of concentration a particular person works in, he or she may be called by variations on the name, including '''tool maker''' ('''toolmaker'''), '''die maker''' ('''diemaker'''), [[Moldmaker|'''mold maker''' ('''moldmaker''')]], '''tool fitter''' ('''toolfitter'''), etc.\n\nTool and die makers work primarily in [[toolroom]] environments\u2014sometimes literally in one room but more often in an environment with flexible, semipermeable boundaries from production work. They are skilled [[artisan]]s ([[craft production|craftspeople]]) who typically learn their trade through a combination of academic coursework and hands-on instruction, with a substantial period of on-the-job training that is functionally an [[apprenticeship]] (although usually not nominally today). Art and science (specifically, [[applied science]]) are thoroughly intermixed in their work, as they also are in [[engineering]]. Mechanical engineers and tool and die makers often work in close consultation. There is often [[turnover (employment)|turnover]] between the careers, as one person may end up working in both at different times of their life, depending on the turns of their particular educational and career path. (In fact, there was no codified difference between them during the 19th century; it was only after [[World War II]] that engineering became a profession exclusively defined by a university or college engineering degree.) Both careers require some level of talent in both artistic/artisanal/creative areas and math-and-science areas. [[Job shop|Job-shop]] machinists can be any combination of toolmaker and production machinist. Some work only as machine operators, whereas others switch fluidly between toolroom tasks and production tasks.\n\n==Job description==\nTraditionally, working from [[engineering drawing]]s, tool makers measure out the design on the raw material (usually metal), then cut it to size and shape using manually controlled machine tools (such as [[Lathes]], [[milling machine]]s, [[grinding machine]]s, and [[jig grinder]]s) and hand tools (such as Files,hones,and stones. Many tool makers now use [[computer-aided design]],and computer-aided machining,to perform these tasks.\n\n===Tool making===\nTool making typically means making tooling used to produce products.  Common tools include metal forming rolls, lathe bits, milling cutters, and form tools. Tool making may also include precision fixturing or machine tools used to manufacture, hold, or test products during their fabrication. Due to the unique nature of a tool maker's work, it is often necessary to fabricate custom tools or modify standard tools.\n\n===Die making===\n{{main|die (manufacturing)}}\nDie making is a subgenre of tool making that focuses on making and maintaining [[die (manufacturing)|dies]].  This often includes making punches, dies, steel rule dies, and die sets.  Precision is key in die making; punches and dies must maintain proper clearance to produce parts accurately, and it is often necessary to have die sets machined with tolerances of less than one thousandth of an inch.\n\n===Overlap===\nOne person may be called upon for all of the above activities, and the skills and concepts involved overlap, which is why \"tool and die making\" is often viewed as one field.\n\n==Training==\nAlthough the details of training programs vary, many tool and die makers begin an [[apprenticeship]] with an employer, possibly including a mix of classroom training and hands-on experience. Some prior qualifications in mathematics, science, engineering or design and technology can be valuable. Many tool and die makers attend a 4- to 5-year apprenticeship program to achieve the status of a [[journeyman]] tool and die maker. Today's employment relationships often differ in name and detail from the traditional arrangement of an apprenticeship, and the terms \"apprentice\" and \"journeyman\" are not always used, but the idea of a period of years of on-the-job training leading to mastery of the field still applies.\n\n==Jig/Fixture maker==\nA jig and fixture maker is under the faction of a tool and die maker/toolmaker. The standard differentiation of jigs from fixtures is that a jig is what mounts onto a workpiece, whereas a fixture has the workpiece placed on it, into it, or next to it. The terms are sometimes used interchangeably. A jig and fixture maker needs to know how to use an assortment of machines to build these devices such as having skills in welding and in some cases the knowledge of wood working equipment, of course with the tool room machining skills.\n\nThey are often advised by an engineer in building the devices. A wide knowledge of various materials is needed beyond wood and metal such as plastics. They also can create, design and build without engineering plans/bluprints.\n\nJig/fixture makers gain hands on practical experience while monitoring and making alterations as the manufacturing process is constantly improved and reviewed with/by engineering. They also can be required to make these adjustments without engineering help, depending on the size of the company.Some Jigs and fixtures require electronic and pneumatic actuation, which will involve knowledge/training in these fields as well.\n\nProperly built jigs and fixtures reduce waste by insuring perfectly fitting parts. Jigs and fixtures can be as big as a car or be held in hand. Production needs dictate form and function. Jigs, fixtures and gages are needed to maintain quality standards for repeated low and high volume production demands.\n\nOngoing evolution of computerized design and control technologies, such as [[CAD/CAM]], [[CNC]], [[PLC]], and others, has limited the use of jigs in manufacturing, however all the computer run machines need some sort of clamping fixture for production runs. A common example is that a drill jig is not needed to guide the drill bits to the hole centers if it is done on a CNC, since it is Computer Numerically Controlled. However, fixtures are still needed to hold the part[s] in place for the operation needed. Jigs are currently needed in many areas of manufacturing but mainly for low-volume production.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Machinist]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Metalworking navbox|all}}\n\n[[Category:Metalworking occupations]]", "Rigger": "'''Rigger''' may refer to:\n\n* One who attends to the [[rigging]] of a sailing ship\n* [[Rigger (entertainment)]], those who tend rigging in stage performance (theater, film, concert, etc.)\n* [[Rigger (industry)]], specializing in moving large/heavy objects\n* [[Parachute rigger]]\n* [[Bondage rigger]], one who ties up others primarily as an art form\n* One who sets up a [[racing shell]] in the sport of rowing\n* Rigger, Duke Nukem's henchman from the animated series [[Captain Planet and the Planeteers#Eco-Villains]]\n\n== See also ==\n* {{lookfrom}}\n* {{intitle}}\n* [[Outrigger]], often used in rowing or canoeing\n* [[Rig (disambiguation)]]\n\n{{disambig}}", "Oiler": "{{Wiktionary}}\n'''Oiler'''  may refer to:\n\n* [[Replenishment oiler]], a type of nautical ship\n* Slang for [[diesel engine]]\n* [[Oiler (occupation)]], an occupation\n** Any person who works in the oilpatch from a [[derrickhand]] to a [[toolpush]]\n*The Oiler, an unnamed character in [[The Open Boat]] by Stephen Crane\n* [[Oiler (Transformers)]], a fictional Transformers character\n* [[Oil can]]\n\n==Sports==\n* [[Cape Breton Oilers]], a former American Hockey League team\n* [[Edmonton Oilers]], a National Hockey League team based in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada\n* [[Houston Oilers]], a former National Football League team\n* [[Southern District Oilers]], a division 1 American football team based in Adelaide, Australia\n* [[Stavanger Oilers]], an ice hockey team based in Stavanger, Norway participating in the GET-ligaen\n\n==See also==\n* [[Euler (disambiguation)]]\n* {{lookfrom}}\n* {{intitle}}\n\n{{Disambig}}", "GD": "{{wiktionary|GD|Gd|Gd.|gd|gd.}}\n'''GD''' may refer to:\n\n==Computing==\n* [[GD Graphics Library]] for dynamically manipulating images\n* [[GD-ROM]], storage media for the Sega Dreamcast\n* [[.gd]], the country code top-level domain for [[Grenada]]\n\n==Science and medicine==\n* [[Gadolinium]] (chemical symbol: Gd), a chemical element\n* [[Gaucher's disease]], the most common of the lipid storage diseases\n* Gaussian distribution, more commonly called the [[normal distribution]], an important family of continuous probability distributions\n* [[Generalized Dirichlet distribution]], a probability distribution also used in statistics \n* Generalized [[dystonia]], a neurological movement disorder\n* [[Gestational diabetes]], a form of diabetes associated with pregnancy\n* [[Gudermannian function]], used in map-making\n* GD, the NATO designation for the toxic chemical [[soman]]\n* The [[International Symposium on Graph Drawing]], an annual academic conference in which researchers present peer reviewed papers on graph drawing, information visualization of network information, geometric graph theory, and related topics\n* [[Graves' disease]], an autoimmune thyroid disorder\n* ''Gain of deiodinases'' or [[Sum activity of peripheral deiodinases]], used in diagnosis of thyroid disorders\n\n==Other==\n* <tt>gd</tt>, ISO 639-1 code for [[Scottish Gaelic]] language\n* GD, the ISO 3166 country code for [[Grenada]]\n* [[Good Delivery]], a specification for gold and silver bars\n* [[Gangster Disciples]], a black street gang in the United States \n* [[Gardner Denver]], a US-based manufacturer of industrial equipment\n* General Delivery (French: [[Poste restante]]), a service where the post office holds mail until the recipient calls for it\n* [[General Dynamics]], a US-based defense conglomerate\n* ''[[Grateful Dead]]'', an American rock band\n* [[Great Depression]], sudden collapse of the economy in the 1920s\n* ''[[Green Day]]'', an American rock band\n* [[G-Dragon]] (born 1988), leader of Korean group Big Bang\n* [[Guangdong]], China\n* [[Georgia Dome]], a stadium in Atlanta, Georgia and the home of the Atlanta Falcons\n\n{{disambiguation}}", "CNC": "#REDIRECT [[Numerical control]]", "Blacksmith": "{{Other uses}}\n{{Refimprove|date=July 2009}}\n{{Infobox Occupation\n| name= Blacksmith\n| image= [[File:Kov\u00e1\u0159 p\u0159i pr\u00e1ci (Velikono\u010dn\u00ed trhy na V\u00e1clavsk\u00e9m n\u00e1m\u011bst\u00ed) 055.jpg|250px]]\n| caption= A modern blacksmith at work.\n| official_names=\n| type= [[Profession]]\n| activity_sector= [[Vocation]]\n| competencies= Physical strength, conceptualization\n| formation=\n| employment_field= Artist, Craftsman\n| related_occupation= [[Farrier]]\n}}\nA '''blacksmith''' is a [[metalsmith]] who creates objects from [[wrought iron]] or [[steel]] by [[forging]] the metal by using tools to hammer, bend, and cut (cf. [[tinsmith|whitesmith]]). Blacksmiths produce objects such as gates, grilles, railings, light fixtures, furniture, sculpture, tools, agricultural implements, decorative and religious items, cooking utensils, and weapons.\n\nWhile there are many people who work with metal such as farriers, wheelwrights, and armorers, the blacksmith had a general knowledge of how to make and repair many things, from the most complex of weapons and armor to simple things like nails or lengths of chain.\n\n==Origin of the term==\nThe \"black\" in \"blacksmith\" refers to the black [[fire scale]], a layer of oxides that forms on the surface of the metal during heating. \"Smith\" is from the Proto-German \"smithaz\" meaning \"skilled worker.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=smith |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-27}}</ref>\n\n==Smithing process==\n\nBlacksmiths work by heating pieces of wrought iron or steel, until the metal becomes soft enough to be shaped with hand tools, such as a hammer, [[anvil]] and [[chisel]]. Heating is accomplished by the use of a [[forge]] fueled by propane, natural gas, coal, charcoal, [[coke (fuel)|coke]] or oil.\n\nSome modern blacksmiths may also employ an [[Oxy-fuel welding and cutting|oxyacetylene]] or similar [[blowlamp|blowtorch]] for more localized heating. [[Induction heating]] methods are gaining popularity among modern blacksmiths.\n\nColor is important for indicating the temperature and workability of the metal: As iron is heated to increasing temperatures, it first [[black-body radiation|glows]] red, then orange, yellow, and finally white. The ideal heat for most forging is the bright yellow-orange color appropriately known as a \"forging heat\". Because they must be able to see the glowing color of the metal, some blacksmiths work in dim, low-light conditions. Most work in well-lit conditions. The key is to have consistent lighting which is not too bright. Direct sunlight obscures the colors.\n\nThe techniques of [[smithing]] may be roughly divided into forging (sometimes called \"sculpting\"), welding, heat treating, and finishing.\n\n===Forging===\n\n[[Forging]] is the process in which metal is shaped by hammering. Forging is different from machining in  that material is not removed by it; rather the iron is hammered into shape. Even punching and cutting operations (except when trimming waste) by smiths will usually re-arrange metal around the hole, rather than drilling it out as swarf.\n\nThere are seven basic operations or techniques employed in forging: drawing down, shrinking (a type of upsetting), bending, upsetting, swageing, punching and forge welding.\n\nThese operations generally employ hammer and [[anvil]] at a minimum, but smiths will also make use of other tools and techniques to accommodate odd-sized or repetitive jobs.\n\n====Drawing====\nDrawing lengthens the metal by reducing one or both of the other two dimensions. As the depth is reduced, or the width narrowed, the piece is lengthened or \"drawn out.\"\n\nAs an example of drawing, a smith making a chisel might flatten a square bar of steel, lengthening the metal, reducing its depth but keeping its width consistent.\n\nDrawing does not have to be uniform. A taper can result as in making a wedge or a woodworking chisel blade. If tapered in two dimensions, a point results.\n\nDrawing can be accomplished with a variety of tools and methods. Two typical methods using only hammer and anvil would be hammering on the anvil horn, and hammering on the anvil face using the cross peen of a hammer.\n\nAnother method for drawing is to use a tool called a [[Fuller (metalworking)|fuller]], or the peen of the hammer, to hasten the drawing out of a thick piece of metal. (The technique is called fullering from the tool.) Fullering consists of hammering a series of indentations with corresponding ridges, perpendicular to the long section of the piece being drawn.  The resulting effect will look somewhat like waves along the top of the piece.  Then the hammer is turned over to use the flat face and the tops of the ridges are hammered down level with the bottoms of the indentations.  This forces the metal  to grow in length (and width if left unchecked) much faster than just hammering with the flat face of the hammer.\n\n=== Bending ===\n[[File:A blacksmith at work.jpg|thumb|left|Canadian blacksmith in the 1970s]]\n\nHeating iron to a \"forging heat\" allows bending as if it were a soft, [[ductile]] metal, like copper or silver.\n\nBending can be done with the hammer over the horn or edge of the anvil or by inserting a bending fork into the Hardy Hole (the square hole in the top of the anvil), placing the work piece between the tines of the fork, and bending the material to the desired angle. Bends can be dressed and tightened, or widened, by hammering them over the appropriately shaped part of the anvil.\n\nSome metals are \"hot short\", meaning they lose their tensile strength when heated. They become like [[Plasticine]]: although they may still be manipulated by squeezing, an attempt to stretch them, even by bending or twisting, is likely to have them crack and break apart. This is a problem for some blade-making steels, which must be worked carefully to avoid developing hidden cracks that will cause failure in the future. Although rarely hand-worked, [[titanium]] is notably hot short. Even such common smithing processes as decoratively twisting a bar are impossible with it.\n\n=== Upsetting ===\nUpsetting is the process of making metal thicker in one dimension through shortening in the other. One form is to heat the end of a rod and then hammer on it as one would drive a nail: the rod gets shorter, and the hot part widens. An alternative to hammering on the hot end is to place the hot end on the anvil and hammer on the cold end.\n\n=== Punching ===\nPunching may be done to create a decorative pattern, or to make a hole. For example, in preparation for making a hammerhead, a smith would punch a hole in a heavy bar or rod for the hammer handle. Punching is not limited to depressions and holes. It also includes cutting, slitting, and drifting\u2014all done with a chisel.\n\n==== Combining processes ====\nThe five basic forging processes are often combined to produce and refine the shapes necessary for finished products. For example, to fashion a cross-peen hammer head, a smith would start with a bar roughly the diameter of the hammer face: the handle hole would be punched and drifted (widened by inserting or passing a larger tool through it), the head would be cut (punched, but with a wedge), the peen would be drawn to a wedge, and the face would be dressed by upsetting.\n\nAs with making a chisel, since it is lengthened by drawing it would also tend to spread in width. A smith would therefore frequently turn the chisel-to-be on its side and hammer it back down\u2014upsetting it\u2014to check the spread and keep the metal at the correct width.\n\nOr, if a smith needed to put a 90-degree bend in a bar and wanted a sharp corner on the outside of the bend, they would begin by hammering an unsupported end to make the curved bend. Then, to \"fatten up\" the outside radius of the bend, one or both arms of the bend would need to be pushed back to fill the outer radius of the curve. So they would hammer the ends of the stock down into the bend, 'upsetting' it at the point of the bend. They would then dress the bend by drawing the sides of the bend to keep the correct thickness. The hammering would continue\u2014upsetting and then drawing\u2014until the curve had been properly shaped. In the primary operation was the bend, but the drawing and upsetting are done to refine the shape.\n\n=== Welding ===\n[[Welding]] is the joining of the same or similar kind of metal.\n[[File:Mendel II 072 r.jpg|thumb|Blacksmith, 1606]]\nA modern blacksmith has a range of options and tools to accomplish this. The basic types of welding commonly employed in a modern workshop include traditional [[forge welding]] as well as modern methods, including oxyacetylene and [[arc welding]].\n\nIn forge welding the pieces to be joined are heated to what is generally referred to as \"welding heat\". For mild steel most smiths judge this temperature by color: the metal will glow an intense yellow or white. At this temperature the steel is near molten.\n\nAny foreign material in the weld, such as the oxides or \"scale\" that typically form in the fire, can weaken it and potentially cause it to fail. Thus the mating surfaces to be joined must be kept clean. To this end a smith will make sure the fire is a reducing fire: a fire where at the heart there is a great deal of heat and very little oxygen. The smith will also carefully shape the mating faces so that as they are brought together foreign material is squeezed out as the metal is joined. To clean the faces, protect them from oxidation, and provide a medium to carry foreign material out of the weld, the smith will sometimes use flux\u2014typically powdered borax, silica sand, or both.\n\nHe will first clean the parts to be joined with a wire brush, then put them in the fire to heat. With a mix of drawing and upsetting the faces will be shaped so that when finally brought together the center of the weld will connect first and the connection will spread outward under the hammer blows, pushing the flux (if used) and foreign material out.\n[[File:3 tourist helping artist blacksmith in finland.JPG|thumb|left|An artist blacksmith and a striker working as one.]]\n\nThe dressed metal goes back in the fire, is brought near to welding heat, removed from the fire, and brushed. Flux is sometimes applied, which prevents oxygen from reaching and burning the metal during forging, and it is returned to the fire. The smith now watches carefully to avoid overheating the metal. There is some challenge to this, because in order to see the color of the metal it must be removed from the fire, and this exposes the metal to air, which can cause it to oxidize rapidly. So the smith might probe into the fire with a bit of steel wire, prodding lightly at the mating faces. When the end of the wire sticks on to the metal, it is at the right temperature (a small weld has formed where the wire touches the mating face so it sticks on to the metal).\nThe smith will commonly place the metal in the fire so as it can be seen without letting the surrounding air come into contact with the surface.\n(Note flux is not always applied, especially in the UK.)\nNow the smith moves with rapid purpose. The metal is taken from the fire and quickly brought to the anvil\u2014the mating faces are brought together, the hammer lightly applying a few taps to bring the mating faces into complete contact and squeeze out the flux\u2014and finally returned to the fire again.\n\nThe weld was begun with the taps, but often the joint is weak and incomplete, so the smith will again heat the joint to welding temperature and work the weld with light blows to \"set\" the weld and finally to dress it to the shape.\n\n=== Finishing ===\n[[Image:Australian blacksmith.jpg|thumb|A blacksmith at work]]\n\nDepending on the intended use of the piece a blacksmith may finish it in a number of ways:\n\n* A simple jig (a tool) that the smith might only use a few times in the shop  may get the minimum of finishing: a rap on the anvil to break off scale and a brushing with a wire brush.\n* Files can be employed to bring a piece to final shape, remove burrs and sharp edges, and smooth the surface.\n* [[Heat treatment]] and [[case-hardening]] to achieve the desired hardness.\n* The wire brush either as a hand tool or power tool can further smooth, brighten and polish surface.\n* Grinding stones, abrasive paper, and emery wheels can further shape, smooth and polish the surface.\n\nThere are a range of treatments and finishes to inhibit oxidation of the metal and enhance or change the appearance of the piece. An experienced smith selects the finish based on the metal and intended use of the item. Finishes include but are not limited to: paint, varnish, [[Bluing (steel)|bluing]], [[Bluing (steel)|browning]], oil, and wax.\n\n== Blacksmith's striker ==<!-- linked from article Harry_Pollitt -->\nA blacksmith's striker is an assistant (frequently an [[apprentice]]), whose job it is to swing a large [[sledgehammer]] in heavy forging operations, as directed by the blacksmith. In practice, the blacksmith will hold the hot iron at the anvil (with tongs) in one hand, and indicate where the iron is to be struck by tapping it with a small hammer held in the other hand: the striker then delivers a heavy blow with the sledgehammer where indicated. During the 20th century and into the 21st century, this role has been increasingly obviated and automated through the use of [[trip hammer]]s or reciprocating power hammers.\n\n== The blacksmith's materials ==\n{{Commons category|Blacksmith's tools}}\nWhen iron [[ore]] is [[smelting|smelted]] into usable metal, a certain amount of [[carbon]] is usually [[alloy]]ed with the iron. (Charcoal is almost pure carbon.) The amount of carbon significantly affects the properties of the metal. If the carbon content is over 2%, the metal is called [[cast iron]], because it has a relatively low melting point and is easily cast. It is quite brittle, however, and cannot be forged so therefore not used for blacksmithing. If the carbon content is between 0.25% and 2%, the resulting metal is [[tool grade steel]], which can be heat treated as discussed above. When the carbon content is below 0.25%, the metal is either \"[[wrought iron]] (wrought iron is not smelted and cannot come from this process) \" or \"mild steel.\"  The terms are never interchangeable. In preindustrial times, the material of choice for blacksmiths was wrought iron. This iron had a very low carbon content, and also included up to 5% of glassy iron silicate [[slag]] in the form of numerous very fine stringers. This slag content made the iron very tough, gave it considerable resistance to rusting, and allowed it to be more easily \"forge welded,\" a process in which the blacksmith permanently joins two pieces of iron, or a piece of iron and a piece of steel, by heating them nearly to a white heat and hammering them together. Forge welding is more difficult to do with modern mild steel because it has a narrower band of temperature at which it will weld. The fibrous nature of wrought iron required knowledge and skill to properly form any tool which would be subject to stress. Modern steel is produced using either the [[blast furnace]] or arc furnaces. Wrought iron was produced by a labor-intensive process called \"puddling,\" so this material is now a difficult-to-find specialty product. Modern blacksmiths generally substitute mild steel for making objects traditionally of wrought iron. Electrolytic-process pure iron is sometimes used.\n\nMany blacksmiths also incorporate materials such as bronze, copper, or brass in artistic products. Aluminum and titanium may also be forged by the blacksmith's process. Each material responds differently under the hammer and must be separately studied by the blacksmith.\n\n== Terminology ==\n[[File:Blacksmith working.jpg|thumb|Hot metal work from a blacksmith]]\n\n* [[Iron]] is a naturally occurring metallic element. It is almost never found in its native form (pure iron) in nature. It is usually found as an [[oxide]] or [[sulfide]], with many other impurity elements mixed in.\n* [[Wrought iron]] is the purest form of iron generally encountered or produced in quantity. It may contain as little as 0.04% [[Carbon]] (by weight). From its traditional method of manufacture, wrought iron has a fibrous internal texture. Quality wrought-iron blacksmithing takes the direction of these fibers into account during forging, since the strength of the material is stronger in line with the grain, than across the grain. Most of the remaining impurities from the initial smelting become concentrated in silicate [[slag]] trapped between the iron fibers. This slag produces a lucky side effect during forge-welding. When the silicate melts, it makes wrought-iron self-fluxing. The slag becomes a liquid glass that covers the exposed surfaces of the wrought-iron, preventing oxidation which would otherwise interfere with the successful welding process.\n* [[Steel]] is a mixture of Iron and between 0.3% to 1.7% Carbon by weight. The presence of carbon allows steel to assume one of several different crystalline configurations. Macroscopically, this is seen as the ability to \"turn the hardness of a piece of steel on and off\" through various processes of heat-treatment. If the concentration of carbon is held constant, this is a reversible process. Steel with a higher carbon percentage may be brought to a higher state of maximum hardness.<ref name=metalsHandbook>{{cite book|last=Davis|first=J.R.|title=Metals Handbook, 2nd Ed.|year=1998|publisher=ASM International|location=Materials Park, OH 44073-0002|ISBN=0-87170-654-7}}</ref>\n* [[Cast iron]] is iron that contains between 2.0% to 6% Carbon by weight. There is so much carbon present, that the hardness cannot be switched off. Hence, cast iron is a brittle metal, which can break like glass. Cast iron cannot be forged without special heat treatment to convert it to [[malleable iron]].<ref name=metalsHandbook />\n\nSteel with below 0.6% Carbon content cannot be hardened by simple heat-treatment enough to make useful hardened-steel tools. Hence, in what follows, wrought-iron, low-carbon-steel, and other soft unhardenable iron varieties will be referred to indiscriminately as just '''iron'''.\n\n== History, prehistory, religion, and mythology ==\n[[Image:SFRR shop.jpg|thumb|left|Hammering out a [[draw bar]] on the steam [[drop hammer]] in the blacksmith shop, [[Santa Fe Railroad]] shops, [[Albuquerque, NM]], 1943.]]\n\n=== Mythology ===\n[[File:V\u00f6lund on ardre 01.png|thumb|right|[[Wayland Smith|Wayland]]'s smithy in the centre, [[Ni\u00f0had|N\u00ed\u00f0u\u00f0]]'s daughter [[B\u00f6\u00f0vildr]] to the left, and N\u00ed\u00f0u\u00f0's dead sons hidden to the right of the smithy.

A supremely skilled artisan whose forge was a volcano, he constructed most of the weapons of the gods, as well as beautiful assistants for his smithy and a metal fishing-net of astonishing intricacy. He was the god of metalworking, fire, and craftsmen.\n\nIn [[Celtic mythology]], the role of Smith is held by eponymous (their names do mean 'smith') characters : [[Goibhniu]]  (Irish myths of the [[Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann]] cycle) or [[Gofannon]] (Welsh myths/ the [[Mabinogion]]  )\n\n[[File:Spectre over Los from William Blake's Jeruesalem.jpg|thumb|The artist [[William Blake]] used the blacksmith as a motif in [[William Blake's mythology|his own extensive mythology]].

He then seduced the king's daughter and escaped laughing on wings he himself had forged.\n\nSeppo [[Ilmarinen]], the Eternal Hammerer, blacksmith and inventor in the [[Kalevala]], is an archetypal artificer from [[Finland|Finnish]] mythology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/kveng/kvrune09.htm |title=The Kalevala: Rune IX. Origin of Iron |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-27}}</ref>\n\n=== Before the Iron Age ===\n[[Gold]], [[silver]], and [[copper]] all occur in nature in their [[native state]]s, as reasonably pure metals - [[humans]] probably worked these metals first. These metals are all quite [[malleable]], and humans' initial development of hammering techniques was undoubtedly applied to these metals.\n\n[[Tubal-cain|Tubal-Cain]] (not to be confused with [[Cain]], brother of [[Abel]]) is mentioned in the book of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] of the [[Old Testament]] (the first book of the [[Torah]]) as the original smith.\n\nDuring the [[Chalcolithic]] era and the [[Bronze Age]], humans in the Mideast learned how to [[smelting|smelt]], [[Melting|melt]], [[Casting (metalworking)|cast]], [[rivet]], and (to a limited extent) [[forge]] copper and bronze. Bronze is an [[alloy]] of copper and approximately 10% to 20% [[Tin]]. Bronze is superior to just copper, by being harder, being more resistant to corrosion, and by having a lower melting point (thereby requiring less fuel to melt and cast). Much of the copper used by the Mediterranean World came from the island of [[Cyprus]]. Most of the tin came from the [[Cornwall]] region of the island of [[Great Britain]], transported by sea-borne [[Phoenicia]]n and [[Greeks|Greek]] traders.\n\nCopper and bronze cannot be hardened by heat-treatment, they can only be hardened by work-hardening. To accomplish this, a piece of bronze is lightly hammered for a long period of time. The localized stress-cycling causes the necessary crystalline changes. The hardened bronze can then be ground to sharpen it to make edged tools.\n\n[[Clockmaker|Clocksmith]]s as recently as the 19th century used [[work hardening]] techniques to harden the teeth of [[brass]] [[gear]]s and [[Ratchet (device)|ratchet]]s. Tapping on just the teeth produced harder teeth, with superior wear-resistance. By contrast, the rest of the gear was left in a softer and tougher state, more capable of resisting cracking.\n\nBronze is sufficiently corrosion-resistant that [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] of bronze may last thousands of years relatively unscathed. Accordingly, museums frequently preserve more examples of Bronze Age metal-work than examples of artifacts from the much younger [[Iron Age]]. Buried iron artifacts may completely [[rust]] away in less than 100 years. Examples of ancient iron work still extant are very much the exception to the norm.\n\n=== Iron Age ===\nConcurrent with the advent of alphabetic characters in the [[Iron Age]], humans became aware of the metal [[iron]]. In earlier ages, iron's qualities, in contrast to those of bronze, were not generally understood though. Iron [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], composed of [[meteoric iron]], have the [[chemical composition]] containing up to 40% [[nickel]]. As this source of this iron is extremely rare and fortuitous, little development of smithing skills peculiar to iron can be assumed to have occurred. That we still possess any such artifacts of meteoric iron may be ascribed to the vagaries of climate, and the increased corrosion-resistance conferred on iron by the presence of nickel.\n\nDuring the (north) Polar Exploration of the early 20th century, [[Inughuit]], northern [[Greenlandic Inuit]], were found to be making iron knives from two particularly large nickel-iron meteors.<ref>{{cite web|last=Schaefer |first=Bradley E. |url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/objects/meteors/3304111.html?page=2&c=y |title=Meteors That Changed the World |publisher=SkyandTelescope.com |work = Meteors |accessdate=2010-07-07}}</ref> One of these meteors was taken to [[Washington, D.C.]], where it was remitted to the custody of the [[Smithsonian Institution]].\n\nThe [[Hittites]] of [[Anatolia]] first discovered or developed the smelting of iron ores around 1500 BC. They  seem to have maintained a near monopoly on the knowledge of iron production for several hundred years, but when their empire collapsed during the Eastern Mediterranean upheavals around 1200 BC, the knowledge seems to have escaped in all directions.\n\nIn the [[Iliad]] of [[Homer]] (describing the [[Trojan War]] and [[Bronze Age]] Greek and Trojan warriors), most of the [[armor]] and weapons (swords and spears) are stated to have been of bronze. Iron is not unknown, however, as [[arrowhead]]s are described as iron, and a \"ball of iron\" is listed as a prize awarded for winning a competition.\nThe events described probably occurred around 1200 BC, but Homer is thought to have composed this epic poem around 700 BC; so exactitude must remain suspect.\n[[Image:Blacksmith Shop Behind Custom House.jpg|thumb|left|A blacksmith shop in the harbor of [[Saint John, New Brunswick]], [[Canada]] in the late 19th century.]]\nWhen historical records resume after the 1200 BC upheavals and the ensuing [[Greek Dark Age]], iron work (and presumably blacksmiths) seem to have sprung like [[Athena]], fully-grown from the head of [[Zeus]]. Very few artifacts remain, due to loss from corrosion, and re-use of iron as a valuable commodity. What information exists indicates that all of the basic operations of blacksmithing were in use as soon as the [[Iron Age]] reached a particular locality. The scarcity of records and artifacts, and the rapidity of the switch from Bronze Age to Iron Age, is a reason to use evidence of bronze smithing to infer about the early development of blacksmithing.\n\nDespite being subject to rust, iron replaced bronze as soon as iron-wielding hordes could invade Bronze Age societies and literally slice through their obsolete bronze defenses. Iron is a stronger and tougher metal than bronze, and iron ores are found nearly everywhere. Copper and Tin deposits, by contrast, are scattered and few, and expensive to exploit.\n\nIron is different from most other materials (including bronze), in that it does not immediately go from a solid to a liquid at its [[melting point]]. H<sub>2</sub>O is a solid (ice) at -1 C (31 F), and a liquid (water) at +1 C (33 F). Iron, by contrast, is definitely a solid at {{convert|800|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}, but over the next {{convert|1500|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} it becomes increasingly plastic and more \"taffy-like\" as its temperature increases. This extreme temperature range of variable solidity is the fundamental material property upon which blacksmithing practice depends.\n\nAnother major difference between bronze and iron fabrication techniques is that bronze ''can'' be melted. The melting point of iron is much higher than that of bronze. In the western (Europe & the Mideast) tradition, the technology to make fires hot enough to melt iron did not arise until the 16th century, when smelting operations grew large enough to require overly large bellows. These produced blast-furnace temperatures high enough to melt partially refined ores, resulting in ''[[cast iron]]''. Thus cast iron frying pans and cookware did not become possible in Europe until 3000 years after the introduction of iron smelting. China, in a separate developmental tradition, was producing cast iron at least 1000 years before this.\n\nAlthough iron is quite abundant, good quality steel remained rare and expensive until the industrial developments of [[Bessemer process]] ''et al.'' in the 1850s. Close examination of blacksmith-made antique tools clearly shows where small pieces of steel were forge-welded into iron to provide the hardened steel cutting edges of tools (notably in axes, adzes, chisels, etc.). The re-use of quality steel is another reason for the lack of artifacts.\n\nThe [[Roman Empire|Romans]] (who ensured that their own weapons were made with good steel) noted (in the 4th century BC) that the [[Celts]] of the Po River Valley had iron, but not good steel. The Romans record that during battle, their Celtic opponents could only swing their swords two or three times before having to step on their swords to straighten them.\n\nOn the [[Indian subcontinent]], [[Wootz]] steel was, and continues to be, produced in small quantities.\n\nIn southern Asia and [[Blacksmiths of western Africa|western Africa]], blacksmiths form [[endogenous]] [[caste]]s that sometimes speak distinct languages.\n\n=== Medieval period ===\n[[Image:Blacksmithmonk.jpg|thumb|A blacksmith [[monk]], from a medieval [[French language|French]] manuscript]]\n\nIn the medieval period, blacksmithing was considered part of the set of ''[[mechanic arts|seven mechanical arts]]''.\n\nPrior to the [[industrial revolution]], a \"village [[Forge|smithy]]\" was a staple of every town. Factories and mass-production reduced the demand for blacksmith-made tools and hardware.\n\nThe original fuel for forge fires was [[charcoal]]. [[Coal]] did not begin to replace charcoal until the forests of first Britain (during the AD 17th century), and then the eastern United States of America (during the 19th century) were largely depleted. Coal ''can be'' an inferior fuel for blacksmithing, because much of the world's coal is contaminated with [[sulfur]]. Sulfur contamination of iron and steel make them \"red short\", so that at red heat they become \"crumbly\" instead of \"plastic\". Coal sold and purchased for blacksmithing should be largely free of sulfur.\n\nEuropean blacksmiths before and through the medieval era spent a great deal of time heating and hammering iron before forging it into finished articles. Although they were unaware of the chemical basis, they were aware that the quality of the iron was thus improved. From a scientific point of view, the reducing atmosphere of the forge was both removing [[oxygen]] (rust), and soaking more [[carbon]] into the iron, thereby developing increasingly higher grades of steel as the process was continued.\n\n=== Industrial era ===\nDuring the eighteenth century, agents for the [[Sheffield]] cutlery industry scoured the country-side of Britain, offering new carriage springs for old. Springs must be made of hardened steel. At this time, the processes by which steel was produced resulted in an extremely variable product: quality was in no way ensured at the initial point of sale. Those springs which had survived cracking through hard use over the rough roads of the time, were proven to be of a better quality steel. Much of the fame of Sheffield cutlery (knives, shears, etc.) was due to these extreme lengths that the companies went to, in order to ensure that high-grade steel was used in their manufactures.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n[[Image:Blacksmith shop, railroad, Topeka.jpg|thumb|left|Blacksmiths at the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]] shops in [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]], [[Kansas]], 1943]] During the first half of the nineteenth century, the US government included in their [[treaties]] with many [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes, that the US would employ blacksmiths and [[wikt:striker|striker]]s at [[Army]] [[fort]]s, with the expressed purpose of providing Native Americans with iron tools and repair services.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nDuring the early to mid-nineteenth century both European armies<ref>An Aide-Memoire to the Military Sciences volume 1'' by Royal Engineers, British Service, 1845, Col.

During the 1790s [[Henry Maudslay]] created the first [[screw-cutting lathe]], a watershed event that signaled the start of blacksmiths being replaced by [[machinist]]s in [[factories]] for the hardware needs of the populace.\n\n[[Samuel Colt]] neither invented nor perfected [[interchangeable parts]], but his insistence (and other industrialists at this time) that his [[firearms]] be manufactured with this property, was another step towards the obsolescence of metal-working artisans and blacksmiths. (See also [[Eli Whitney]]).\n[[Image:SLCBlacksmiths.jpg|thumb|High school blacksmith class, [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], 1915]]\nAs demand for their products declined, many more blacksmiths augmented their incomes by taking in work shoeing [[horse]]s. A shoer-of-horses was historically known as a [[farrier]] in English. With the introduction of [[automobile]]s, the number of blacksmiths continued to decrease, many former blacksmiths becoming the initial generation of automobile [[Mechanic]]s. The nadir of blacksmithing in the United States was reached during the 1960s, when most of the former blacksmiths had left the trade, and few if any new people were entering the trade. By this time, most of the working blacksmiths were those performing [[farrier]] work, so the term ''blacksmith'' was effectively co-opted by the farrier trade.\n\n== 20th century ==\n\nDuring the 20th century various gases ([[natural gas]], [[acetylene]], etc.) have also come to be used as fuels for blacksmithing. While these are fine for blacksmithing iron, special care must be taken when using them to blacksmith steel. Each time a piece of steel is heated, there is a tendency for the carbon content to leave the steel ([[decarburization]]). This can leave a piece of steel with an effective layer of unhardenable iron on its surface. In a traditional charcoal or coal forge, the fuel is really just carbon. In a properly regulated charcoal/coal fire, the air in and immediately around the fire should be a [[oxidizing and reducing flames|reducing]] atmosphere. In this case, and at elevated temperatures, there is a tendency for vaporized carbon to soak ''into'' steel and iron, counteracting or negating the decarburizing tendency. This is similar to the process by which a '''case''' of steel is developed on a piece of iron in preparation for [[case hardening]].\n[[File:4 artist blacksmith forging with power hammer.JPG|thumb|left|An Artist Blacksmith working with a power hammer in Bodom, [[Finland]], 2011]]\nA renewed interest in blacksmithing occurred as part of the trend in \"do-it-yourself\" and \"self-sufficiency\" that occurred during the 1970s. Currently there are many books, organizations and individuals working to help educate the public about blacksmithing, including local groups of smiths who have formed clubs, with some of those smiths demonstrating at historical sites and living history events.  Some modern blacksmiths who produce decorative metalwork refer to themselves as artist-blacksmiths.

This is accomplished by using machine tools to cut away excess material much as a woodcarver cuts away excess wood to produce his work.  In addition to metal, the parts may be made of many other kinds of materials, such as plastic or wood products.  The goal of these cutting operations is to produce a part that conforms to a set of specifications, or tolerances, usually in the form of [[engineering drawings]] commonly known as [[blueprints]].\n\n==Related occupational titles==\nWithin the title machinist are other specialty titles that refer to specific skills that may be more highly developed to meet the needs of a particular job position. Some examples of these specialty titles are fitter, turning hand, mill hand, and grinder. Also, there are  titles that are related but actually are a further development of machinist skills such as [[tool and die maker]], [[tool maker]], trim die maker, die sinker, [[Model maker|patternmaker]] and [[mold maker]].  These latter titles are also more commonly found in specialized areas of industry.\n\nA fitter and turner refers to a person who manufactures mechanical parts (turner) and assembles (fitter) those parts together to manufacture a mechanical device.\n\n==The role of the machinist in manufacturing==\nA machinist is usually called upon when a part needs to be produced from a material by cutting. Such a part may be unique or may be needed in the thousands. This could include a machinery part for a production line or anything that can be made from metal or plastic.  Producing a part will often require several steps and more than one machine tool.  Each machine tool plays a specific role in cutting away excess material.  When large numbers of parts are needed, production planning is required to plan the most logical workflow through a series of machines. [[cnc|Computer numerically controlled (CNC)]] machines are a special computer-driven tool that can machine a large variety of shapes, and whose use in the workflow depends on the part to be machined.\n\nCNC machines are becoming the standard due to their speed, precision, flexibility, and reduced downtime while changing jobs.  Production runs consisting of large numbers of parts are more cost effective (in a local and narrow sense) and commonly referred to as [[Mass production|production work]] in the trade.  Conversely, small production runs are sometimes referred to as prototype or jobbing work.\n\nProduction engineers use blueprints and engineering drawings to produce detailed specifications of the part, especially its geometry (shape), then decide on a strategy to make it. Machine tools are then configured by the machinist or '''toolsetter'''  and production commences. The machinist works with the quality department to ensure the specifications are maintained in the finished product.\n\n==Materials commonly encountered by machinists==\nA machinist is to metal as a [[woodcarver]] is to wood. The most common materials  that machinists make parts from are [[steel]], [[aluminium]], [[brass]], [[copper]], and various [[alloys]] of these materials.  Other less common materials such as [[vanadium]], [[zinc]], [[lead]], or [[manganese]] are often used as [[alloying elements]] for the most common materials. Materials that machinists work with occasionally are [[plastics]], [[rubber]], [[glass]], and wood products.  Rarely, machinists also work with exotic and [[refractory metals]]. The term exotic metals is a general term describing out of the ordinary, rare or special purpose metals. A synonym might be space-age. A list of exotic metals might include, but is not limited to, [[titanium]], [[beryllium]], vanadium, [[chromium]], [[molybdenum]] and [[tungsten]], as well as special high-temperature metal alloys like [[Inconel]] or [[Hastelloy]] (sometimes called [[superalloys]]).  Very often the meaning of the term suggests the need for specialised handling and/or tooling to machine them effectively.\n\nWhile the foregoing were primarily the materials that a machinist would be cutting, the cutters that the machinist uses must be harder and tougher than the materials to be cut.  The materials in the cutters a machinist uses are most commonly [[high speed steel]], [[tungsten carbide]], [[ceramic]]s, [[Borazon]], and [[diamond]].\n\nMachinists usually work to very small [[Engineering tolerance|tolerances]], usually within 0.010\" or 0.25&nbsp;mm (more commonly expressed as \u00b10.010\"(Plus or minus ten-thousands of an inch) or \u00b10.13&nbsp;mm), and sometimes at tolerances as low as 0.0001\" (plus or minus one tenth of a thousand of an inch \u2013 or 0.0025&nbsp;mm) for specialty operations. A machinist deals with all facets of shaping, cutting and some aspects of forming metal, although forming is typically a separate trade.  The operations most commonly performed by machinists are [[milling machine|milling]], [[drilling]], [[turning]], and [[Grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]].  There are other more specialised operations that a machinist will less frequently be called upon to perform such as [[honing]], [[keyseating]], [[lapping]], and [[polishing]], to name a few.\n\n==Tools of the machinist==\nThe tools that a machinist is expected to be proficient with fall into 6 broad categories:\n\n*'''Measuring tools:''' The measuring tools come several basic varieties:\n**Comparison tools such as adjustable [[parallels (engineering)|parallels]] and plain [[calipers]],\n**Direct reading tools such as rules, scales, and [[vernier scale|vernier calipers]],\n**[[Micrometer]] tools based on screw threads,\n**[[Dial indicator|Indicator]] tools based on [[clockwork]] gear movements,\n**Electronic measuring tools based on [[transducer]]s.  Many of these are digital versions of their mechanical predecessors, as with a digital [[caliper]].\n*'''Hand tools:''' The hand tools are the usual complement of tools found in a complete auto mechanic's set except that auto specialty tools would be absent and some outsized tools would likely be present, such as 1&nbsp;1/2\" (38&nbsp;mm) open end wrench.\n*'''Machine tools:''' The machine tools have undergone a dramatic shift in the last 20 years.  Manual machines have given way to computer numerically controlled machines (CNCs).  For clarity's sake a categorization based on the historical groupings will be offered. Each of these groupings has been altered by the advent of CNCs and the CNCs meld some groups and blur the lines between others. In the past, the most common machine tools fall into 4 categories:\n**Drilling machines, bench, floor, radial, and horizontal\n**Milling machines, horizontal, vertical, and boring mills\n**Turning machines, engine lathe, turret lathe, vertical turret lathe, vertical boring mill\n**[[Grinding machine]]s, surface, cylindrical, centerless, universal\n*'''Workholders:''' The workholders may include [[Vise (tool)|vise]]s, chucks, indexing accessories, pallets, specialty jigs or fixtures, and faceplates\n*'''Toolholders:''' The toolholders may include [[Chuck (engineering)|chuck]]s, cutter adapters, cutter extension, tool posts, indexable turrets, box tools, quick change adapters, [[mandrel|arbor]]s, and [[collet]]s.\n*'''Cutting tools:''' Cutting tools include various milling cutters such as [[face mill]]s, [[shell mill]]s, [[endmill]]s, and form cutters; various [[Drill bit|drills]], [[reamers]], [[tap and die|taps]], [[countersink]]s, [[counterbore]]s, and [[core drill]]s; various [[Tool bit|turning tools]], form tools, and [[threading (manufacturing)|threading]] tools; various grinding wheels distinguished by their geometry, bond, grit size, and compound.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of metalworking occupations]]\n*[[Machinist calculator]]\n*[[International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers]]\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos223.htm U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Outlook Handbook]\n*[http://www.goiam.org The Machinists Union: IAMAW]\n\n{{Metalworking navbox|machopen}}\n\n[[Category:Machinists| ]]", "Inspection": "{{Refimprove|date=June 2007}}\n[[File:EA-6B Prowler maintenance check.jpg|thumb|Maintenance check of electronic equipment on a U.S. Navy aircraft.]]\nAn '''inspection''' is, most generally, an organized [[examination]] or formal evaluation exercise. In engineering activities inspection involves the measurements, tests, and gauges applied to certain characteristics in regard to  an object or activity. The results are usually compared to specified [[requirement]]s and standards for determining whether the item or activity is in line with these targets. Inspections are usually non-destructive. \n\nA 2007 Scottish Government review of scrutiny of public services (the Crear Review, 2007<ref name=\"Crear\">Crerar, Professor Lorne D, September 2007 The Crerar Review: The report of the independent review of regulation, audit, inspection and complaints handling of public services in Scotland.</ref>[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/82980/0053065.pdf]) defined inspection of public services as \"... periodic, targeted scrutiny of specific services, to check whether they are meeting national and local performance standards, legislative and professional requirements, and the needs of service users.\"\n\nA ''surprise inspection'' tends to have different results than an announced inspection. Leaders wanting to know how others in their organization perform can drop in without warning, to see directly what  happens. If an inspection is made known in advance, it can give people a chance to cover up or to fix mistakes. This could lead to distorted and inaccurate findings. A surprise inspection, therefore, gives inspectors a better picture of the typical state of the inspected object or process than an announced inspection. It also enhances external confidence in the inspection process.

The importer instructs the shipper which inspection company should be used. The inspector makes pictures and a report to certify that the goods that are being shipped and produced are in accordance with the accompanying documents.\n\nCommodity inspection is other term that is used between buyers and sellers. The scope of work for commodity inspection depends to the buyers. Some buyers hire the inspection agencies only for pre-shipment inspections i.e. visual quality, quantity, packing, marking and loading inspections and some others request for higher level inspections and ask inspection agencies to attend in the vendor shops and inspect commodities during manufacturing processes. Normally inspection is done based on an agreed inspection and test plan (ITP).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inspection-for-industry.com/commodity_inspection.html |title=Commodity Inspection Services.

Inspections are used for the purpose of determining if a body is complying with regulations. The inspector examines the criteria and talks with involved individuals. A report and evaluation follows such visits.\n\nThe [[Food Safety Inspection Service]] is charged with ensuring that all meat and egg products in the United States are safe to consume and accurately labeled. The [[Meat Inspection Act]] of 1906 authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to order meat inspections and condemn any found unfit for human consumption.

Machine tools employ some sort of tool that does the cutting or shaping.  All machine tools have some means of constraining the workpiece and provide a guided movement of the parts of the machine.   Thus the relative movement between the workpiece and the [[cutting tool]] (which is called the '''toolpath''') is controlled or constrained by the machine to at least some extent, rather than being entirely \"offhand\" or \"[[wikt:freehand#Adjective|freehand]]\".\n\nThe precise definition of the term ''machine tool'' varies among users, as detailed in the [[#Nomenclature and key concepts, interrelated|\"Nomenclature and key concepts\"]] section. It is safe to say that all machine tools are \"machines that help people to make things\", although not all factory machines are machine tools.\n\nToday machine tools are typically powered other than by human muscle (e.g., electrically, hydraulically, or via [[line shaft]]), used to make manufactured parts (components) in various ways that include cutting or certain other kinds of deformation.\n\nWith their inherent precision, machine tools enabled the economical production of [[interchangeable parts]].\n\n==Nomenclature and key concepts, interrelated==\nMany [[history of technology|historians of technology]] consider that true machine tools were born when the toolpath first became guided by the machine itself in some way, at least to some extent, so that direct, [[wikt:freehand#Adjective|freehand]] human guidance of the toolpath (with hands, feet, or mouth) was no longer the only guidance used in the cutting or forming process. In this view of the definition, the term, arising at a time when all tools up till then had been [[hand tool]]s, simply provided a label for \"tools that were machines instead of hand tools\". Early lathes, those prior to the late [[medieval]] period, and modern woodworking lathes and [[potter's wheel]]s may or may not fall under this definition, depending on how one views the headstock [[spindle (tool)|spindle]] itself; but the earliest historical records of a lathe with direct mechanical control ''of the cutting tool's path'' are of a screw-cutting lathe dating to about 1483.<ref name=\"Moore1970p137\">{{Harvnb|Moore|1970|p=137, figure 213}}.</ref> This lathe \"produced screw threads out of wood and employed a true compound slide rest\".\n\nThe mechanical toolpath guidance grew out of any of various root concepts:\n* First is the [[spindle (tool)|spindle]] concept itself, which constraints workpiece or tool movement to [[rotation around a fixed axis]]. This ancient concept predates machine tools per se; the earliest lathes and [[potter's wheel]]s incorporated it for the workpiece, but the movement of the tool itself on these machines was entirely freehand.\n* The machine slide, which has many forms, such as dovetail ways, box ways, or cylindrical column ways. Machine slides constrain tool or workpiece movement [[wikt:linear#Adjective|linearly]]. If a stop is added, the ''length'' of the line can also be accurately controlled. (Machine slides are essentially a subset of [[linear bearing]]s, although the language used to classify these various [[machine element]]s includes [[connotation|connotative]] boundaries; some users in some contexts would contradistinguish elements in ways that others might not.)\n* Tracing, which involves following the contours of a model or template and transferring the resulting motion to the toolpath.\n* [[Cam]] operation, which is related in principle to tracing but can be a step or two removed from the traced element's matching the reproduced element's final shape. For example, several cams, no one of which directly matches the desired output shape, can actuate a complex toolpath by creating component [[Euclidean vector|vectors]] that add up to a net toolpath.\n\nAbstractly programmable toolpath guidance began with mechanical solutions, such as in [[musical box]] cams and [[Jacquard loom]]s. The [[technological convergence|convergence]] of programmable mechanical control with machine tool toolpath control was delayed many decades, in part because the programmable control methods of musical boxes and looms lacked the rigidity for machine tool toolpaths. Later, electromechanical solutions (such as [[servomechanism|servos]]) and soon electronic solutions (including [[computer]]s) were added, leading to [[numerical control|numerical control and computer numerical control]].\n\nWhen considering the difference between freehand toolpaths and machine-constrained toolpaths, the concepts of [[accuracy and precision]], [[efficiency]], and [[productivity]] become important in understanding ''why'' the machine-constrained option adds [[value (economics)|value]]. After all, humans are generally quite talented in their freehand movements; the drawings, paintings, and [[sculpture]]s of artists such as [[Michelangelo]] or [[Leonardo da Vinci]], and of countless other talented people, show that human freehand toolpath has great potential. The [[value (economics)|value]] that machine tools added to these human talents is in the areas of rigidity (constraining the toolpath despite thousands of [[newton (unit)|newtons]] ([[pound-force|pounds]]) of force fighting against the constraint), [[accuracy and precision]], [[efficiency]], and [[productivity]]. With a machine tool, toolpaths that no human muscle could constrain can be constrained; and toolpaths that are technically possible with freehand methods, but would require tremendous time and skill to execute, can instead be executed quickly and easily, even by people with little freehand talent (because the machine takes care of it). The latter aspect of machine tools is often referred to by historians of technology as \"building the skill into the tool\", in contrast to the toolpath-constraining skill being in the ''person'' who wields the tool. As an example, it is ''physically possible'' to make [[interchangeable parts|interchangeable]] screws, bolts, and nuts entirely with freehand toolpaths. But it is ''economically practical'' to make them only with machine tools.\n\nIn the 1930s, the U.S. National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) referenced the definition of a machine tool as \"any machine operating by other than hand power which employs a tool to work on metal\".<ref name=\"Jerome1934\">{{Harvnb|Jerome|1934|p=178, Ch. 4, Note 75}}.</ref>\n\nThe narrowest [[colloquial]] sense of the term reserves it only for machines that perform metal cutting\u2014in other words, the many kinds of [conventional] [[machining]] and [[grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]]. These processes are a type of deformation that produces [[swarf]]. However, [[economist]]s use a slightly broader sense that also includes metal deformation of other types that squeeze the metal into shape without cutting off swarf, such as rolling, stamping with [[die (manufacturing)|dies]], shearing, [[swaging]], [[rivet]]ing, and others. Thus [[machine press|presses]] are usually included in the economic definition of machine tools. For example, this is the breadth of definition used by [[Max Holland]] in his history of Burgmaster and Houdaille,<ref name=\"Holland1989\">{{Harvnb|Holland|1989}}.</ref> which is also a history of the machine tool industry in general from the 1940s through the 1980s; he was reflecting the sense of the term used by Houdaille itself and other firms in the industry. Many reports on machine tool [[export]] and [[import]] and similar economic topics use this broader definition.\n\nThe colloquial sense implying [conventional] metal cutting is also growing obsolete because of changing technology over the decades. The many more recently developed processes labeled \"machining\", such as [[electrical discharge machining]], [[electrochemical machining]], [[electron beam machining]], [[photochemical machining]], and [[ultrasonic machining]], or even [[plasma cutting]] and [[water jet cutter|water jet cutting]], are often performed by machines that could most logically be called machine tools. In addition, some of the newly developed [[additive manufacturing]] processes, which are not about cutting away material but rather about adding it, are done by machines that are likely to end up labeled, in some cases, as machine tools. In fact, [[machine tool builder]]s are already developing machines that include both subtractive and additive manufacturing in one work envelope,<ref name=\"Zelinski_2013-11-08\">{{Citation |last=Zelinski |first=Peter |date=2013-11-08 |title=Hybrid machine combines milling and additive manufacturing |journal=[[Modern Machine Shop]] |url=http://www.mmsonline.com/blog/post/hybrid-machine-combines-milling-and-additive-manufacturing |postscript=.}}</ref> and retrofits of existing machines are underway.<ref name=\"Zelinski_2014-02-21\">{{Citation |last=Zelinski |first=Peter |date=2014-02-21 |title=The capacity to build 3D metal forms is a retrofittable option for subtractive CNC machine tools |journal=[[Modern Machine Shop]] Additive Manufacturing supplement |url=http://www.additivemanufacturinginsight.com/articles/add-on-additive-manufacturing |postscript=.}}</ref>\n\nThe [[natural language]] use of the terms varies, with subtle [[connotation|connotative]] boundaries. Many speakers resist using the term \"machine tool\" to refer to [[woodworking machine]]ry (joiners, table saws, routing stations, and so on), but it is difficult to maintain any true logical dividing line, and therefore many speakers are fine with a broad definition. It is common to hear machinists refer to their machine tools simply as \"machines\". Usually the [[mass noun]] \"machinery\" encompasses them, but sometimes it is used to imply only those machines that are being excluded from the definition of \"machine tool\". This is why the machines in a food-processing plant, such as conveyors, mixers, vessels, dividers, and so on, may be labeled \"machinery\", while the machines in the factory's tool and die department are instead called \"machine tools\" in contradistinction. As for the 1930s NBER definition quoted above, one could argue that its specificity to metal is obsolete, as it is quite common today for particular lathes, milling machines, and machining centers (definitely machine tools) to work exclusively on plastic cutting jobs throughout their whole working lifespan. Thus the NBER definition above could be expanded to say \"which employs a tool to work on metal ''or other materials of high hardness''\". And its specificity to \"operating by other than hand power\" is also problematic, as machine tools can be powered by people if appropriately set up, such as with a [[treadle]] (for a [[lathe]]) or a hand lever (for a [[shaper]]). Hand-powered shapers are clearly \"the 'same thing' as shapers with electric motors except smaller\", and it is trivial to power a [[micro lathe]] with a hand-cranked belt pulley instead of an electric motor. Thus one can question whether power source is truly a key distinguishing concept; but for economics purposes, the NBER's definition made sense, because most of the commercial value of the existence of machine tools comes about via those that are powered by electricity, hydraulics, and so on. Such are the vagaries of [[natural language]] and [[controlled vocabulary]], both of which have their places in the business world.\n\n== History ==\nForerunners of machine tools included bow drills and potter's wheels, which had existed in ancient Egypt prior to 2500 BC, and lathes, known to have existed in multiple regions of Europe since at least 1000 to 500 BC.<ref name=\"Woodbury_1972_1961_pp18-35\">{{Harvnb|Woodbury|1972|pp=18\u201335}}.</ref> But it was not until the later [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment]] that the modern concept of a machine tool\u2014a class of machines used as tools in the making of metal parts, and incorporating machine-guided toolpath\u2014began to evolve. [[Clockmaker]]s of the Middle Ages and [[polymath|renaissance men]] such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] helped expand humans' technological milieu toward the preconditions for industrial machine tools. During the 18th and 19th centuries, and even in many cases in the 20th, the builders of machine tools tended to be the same people who would then use them to produce the end products (manufactured goods). However, from these roots also evolved an industry of machine tool builders as we define them today, meaning people who specialize in building machine tools for sale to others.\n\nHistorians of machine tools often focus on a handful of major industries that most spurred machine tool development. In order of historical emergence, they have been [[firearm]]s (small arms and [[artillery]]); [[horology|clocks]]; textile machinery; steam engines ([[stationary steam engine|stationary]], [[marine steam engine|marine]], [[locomotive|rail]], and [[history of steam road vehicles|otherwise]]) (the story of how [[James Watt|Watt]]'s need for an accurate cylinder spurred Boulton's boring machine is discussed by Roe<ref name=\"Roe1916\">{{Harvnb|Roe|1916}}</ref>); [[sewing machine]]s; [[bicycle]]s; [[automobile]]s; and [[aircraft]]. Others could be included in this list as well, but they tend to be connected with the root causes already listed. For example, [[rolling-element bearing]]s are an industry of themselves, but this industry's main drivers of development were the vehicles already listed\u2014trains, bicycles, automobiles, and aircraft; and other industries, such as tractors, farm implements, and tanks, borrowed heavily from those same parent industries.\n\nMachine tools filled a need created by textile machinery during the [[Industrial Revolution]] in England in the middle to late 1700s.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Roe1916}}</ref>  Until that time machinery was made mostly from wood, often including gearing and shafts.  The increase in [[mechanization]] required more metal parts, which were usually made of [[cast iron]] or [[wrought iron]].  Cast iron could be cast in molds for larger parts, such as engine cylinders and gears, but was difficult to work with a file and could not be hammered.  Red hot wrought iron could be hammered into shapes.  Room temperature wrought iron was worked with a file and chisel and could be made into gears and other complex parts; however, hand working lacked precision and was a slow and expensive process.\n\n[[James Watt]] was unable to have an accurately bored cylinder for his first steam engine, trying for several years until [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)|John Wilkinson]] invented a suitable boring machine in 1774, boring Boulton & Watt's first commercial engine in 1776.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe advance in the accuracy of machine tools can be traced to Henry Maudslay and refined by Joseph Whitworth. That Maudslay had established the manufacture and use of master plane gages in his shop (Maudslay & Field) located on Westminster Road south of the Thames River in London about 1809, was attested to by James Nasmyth who was employed by Maudslay in 1829 and Nasmyth documented their use in his autobiography. \n\nThe process by which the master plane gages were produced dates back to antiquity but was refined to an unprecedented degree in the Maudslay shop. The process begins with three plates each given an identification (ex., 1,2 and 3). The first step is to rub plates 1 and 2 together with a marking medium (called bluing today) revealing the high spots which would be removed by hand scraping with a steel scraper, until no irregularities were visible. This would not produce absolutely true plane surfaces but a \"ball and socket\" fit, as this mechanical fit, like two perfect planes, can slide over each other and reveal no high spots. Next, plate number 3 would be compared and scraped to conform to plate number 1. In this manner plates number 2 and 3 would be identical. Next plates number 2 and 3 would be checked against each other to determine what condition existed, either both plates were \"balls\" or \"sockets\". These would then be scraped until no high spots existed and then compared to plate number 1. After repeating this process, comparing and scraping the three plates together, they would automatically generate exact true plane surfaces accurate to within millionths of an inch.\n\nThe traditional method of producing the surface gages used an abrasive powder rubbed between the plates to remove the high spots, but it was Whitworth who contributed the refinement of replacing the grinding with hand scraping. Sometime after 1825 Whitworth went to work for Maudslay and it was there that Whitworth perfected the hand scraping of master surface plane gages. In his paper presented to the British Association for the Advancement of Science at Glasgow in 1840, Whitworth pointed out the inherent inaccuracy of grinding due to no control and thus unequal distribution of the abrasive material between the plates which would produce uneven removal of material from the plates. \n\nWith the creation of master plane gages of such high accuracy, all critical components of machine tools (i.e., guiding surfaces such as machine ways) could then be compared against them and scraped to the desired accuracy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Roe|first=Joseph Wickham|title=English and American Tool Builders|year=1916|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0-917914-73-2}}</ref>    \n\nThe first machine tools offered for sale (i.e., commercially available) were constructed by [[Matthew Murray]] in England around 1800.<ref name=\"Moore1970\">{{Harvnb|Moore|1970}}.</ref> Others, such as [[Henry Maudslay]], [[James Nasmyth]], and [[Joseph Whitworth]], soon followed the path of expanding their entrepreneurship from manufactured end products and [[millwright]] work into the realm of building machine tools for sale.\n\nImportant early machine tools included the slide rest lathe, [[screw-cutting lathe]], [[turret lathe]], [[milling machine]], pattern tracing lathe, [[shaper]], and [[planer (metalworking)|metal planer]], which were all in use before 1840.<ref name=\"Thomson 2009\">{{Citation\n|title=Structures of Change in the Mechanical Age: Technological Invention in the United States 1790-1865\n |last=Thomson\n |first= Ross\n|authorlink=\n|coauthors=\n|year=2009 |publisher =The Johns Hopkins University Press\n|location= Baltimore, MD\n|isbn= 978-0-8018-9141-0}}\n</ref>  With these machine tools the decades old objective of producing [[interchangeable parts]] was finally realized.  An important early example of something now taken for granted was the standardization of screw fasteners such as nuts and bolts.  Before about the beginning of the 19th century, these were used in pairs, and even screws of the same machine were generally not interchangeable.<ref>Rybczynsky, ''One Good Turn'', 2000, ISBN 0-684-86729-X</ref>  Methods were developed to cut screw thread to a greater precision than that of the feed screw in the lathe being used.  This led to the bar [[Meter|length standard]]s of the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nThe production of machine tools is concentrated in about 10 countries worldwide: China, Japan, Germany, Italy, South Korea, Taiwan, Switzerland, USA, Austria, Spain and a few others. Machine tool innovation continues in several public and private research centers worldwide.\n\n==Drive power sources==\n<blockquote>\u201call the turning of the iron for the cotton machinery built by [[Samuel Slater|Mr. Slater]] was done with hand chisels or tools in lathes turned by cranks with hand power\u201d.  [[David Wilkinson (machinist)|David Wilkinson]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Thomson|2009|pp=24|}}</ref></blockquote>\nMachine tools can be powered from a variety of sources.  Human and animal power (via [[crank (mechanism)|crank]]s, [[treadle]]s, [[treadmill]]s, or [[treadwheel]]s) were used in the past, as was water power (via [[water wheel]]); however, following the development of high-pressure steam engines in the mid 19th century, factories increasingly used steam power.  Factories also used hydraulic and pneumatic power.  Many small workshops continued to use water, human and animal power until [[electrification]] after 1900.<ref name = \"Hunter&Bryant 1991\">\n{{Citation\n|title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730-1930, Vol. 3: The Transmission of Power\n |last1=Hunter\n |first1= Louis C.\n|last2=Bryant\n|first2=Lynwood\n|authorlink=\n|coauthors= Bryant, Lynwood\n|year=1991 |publisher =MIT Press\n|location= Cambridge, Massachusetts, London\n|isbn=0-262-08198-9 |page=}}\n</ref>\n\nToday most machine tools are powered by electricity; however, hydraulic and pneumatic power are sometimes used, but this is uncommon.\n\n==Automatic control==\nMachine tools can be operated manually, or under automatic control.  Early machines used [[flywheel]]s to stabilize their motion and had complex systems of gears and levers to control the machine and the piece being worked on.  Soon after World War II, the [[numerical control]] (NC) machine was developed. NC machines used a series of numbers punched on [[paper tape]] or [[punched card]]s to control their motion.  In the 1960s, computers were added to give even more flexibility to the process. Such machines became known as computerized numerical control (CNC) machines.  NC and CNC machines could precisely repeat sequences over and over, and could produce much more complex pieces than even the most skilled tool operators.\n\nBefore long, the machines could automatically change the specific cutting and shaping tools that were being used.  For example, a [[drill]] machine might contain a magazine with a variety of [[drill bit]]s for producing holes of various sizes.  Previously, either machine operators would usually have to manually change the bit or move the work piece to another station to perform these different operations. The next logical step was to combine several different machine tools together, all under computer control.  These are known as [[machining center]]s, and have dramatically changed the way parts are made.\n\nFrom the simplest to the most complex, most machine tools are capable of at least partial [[self-replicating machine|self-replication]], and produce machine parts as their primary function.\n\n== Examples ==\n\nExamples of machine tools are:\n\n* [[Broach (metalwork)|Broaching machine]]\n* [[Drill#Drill press|Drill press]]\n* [[Gear shaper]]\n* [[Hobbing machine]]\n* [[Hone]]\n* [[Lathe (tool)|Lathe]]\n* [[Screw machine (automatic lathe)|Screw machine]]s\n* [[Milling machine]]\n* [[Shear (sheet metal)]]\n* [[Shaper]]\n* [[Saws]]\n* [[Planer (metalworking)|Planer]]\n* [[Stewart platform]] mills\n* [[Grinding machine]]s\n* Multitasking machines (MTMs)\u2014CNC machine tools with many axes that combine turning, milling, grinding, and material handling into one highly automated machine tool\n\nWhen fabricating or shaping parts, several techniques are used to remove unwanted metal.  Among these are:\n\n* [[Electrical discharge machining]]\n* [[Grinding (abrasive cutting)]]\n* [[cutting tool (metalworking)|Multiple edge cutting tools]]\n* Single edge cutting tools\n\nOther techniques are used to ''add'' desired material.

The name originated from craftsmen who would fabricate [[boiler]]s, but they may work on projects as diverse as [[bridge]]s to [[blast furnace]]s to the construction of mining equipment.\n\n==Boilermaking==\nMany boilermakers are employed in repairing, [[repiping]], and re-tubing commercial steam and hot water boilers used for heating and domestic hot water in commercial buildings and multi-family dwellings. Sometimes these boilers are referred to as [[pressure vessel]]s. Generally, a pressure vessel is a storage tank or vessel that has been designed to operate at pressures above 15 p.s.i.g. The two main tasks of boilermakers involve using [[oxy-acetylene]] gas torch sets to cut or gouge steel plate and tubes, followed by [[gas tungsten arc welding]] (GTAW), [[shielded metal arc welding]] (SMAW), or [[gas metal arc welding]] (GMAW) to attach and mend the cut sections of tubes and steel plates.\n\n==R Stamp Welding==\nBoiler repair in the United States is governed by the [[ National Board of Boiler and Pressure Vessel Inspectors]] and the ASME under a classification called R Stamp Welding. In order to perform R Stamp welds and repairs, boilermakers are tested and certified in the quality of their weld joints through a rigorous testing procedure. R stamps are issued to companies that have existing ASME code stamps issued for construction and whose QC system covers repairs or follow the guidelines set up by ASME to obtain an R stamp. Welders identify their welds by stamping their identifying welder number adjacent to their completed weld with a set of steel stencils.\n\n==Power piping==\nThe trade of Boilermaker evolved from the industrial blacksmith and was known in the early 19th century as a \"[[boilersmith]]\".  The involvement of boilermakers in the shipbuilding industry came about because of the changeover from wood to iron as a construction material.  It was easier (and cheaper) to utilize the boilermaker's skills to construct the ship as they were already present in the shipyard constructing iron boilers for wooden steamships.  This utilization of skills extended to virtually everything that was large and made of iron, or later, steel.\n\nWelding, fitting, and installing the tubes and accessories that attach to the boiler can also be performed by boilermakers, and is governed by the same organizations as R Stamp Welding, except this certification is called Powerpiping certification. The Powerpiping stamp contains two \"P\"s, the first inverted so that it mirrors the second.\nPower Piping is governed by ASME Code section B31.1.\n\n==Application==\nBoilermaking, welding, and fitting tubes can be a full-time year round project at powerplants- since stress fractures, leaks, and rust and corrosion cause a continual need for repair or replacement, and power plants often operate at very high steam pressures. Other boilermakers might work seasonally or on an individual project such as re-fitting a boiler in a seagoing vessel, or in the one-time remodeling of a steam plant. \n\nBoiler repair can be a very valuable service since even the smallest steam boilers for dry cleaners, tailor and alterations shops can cost upwards of ten to twenty thousand dollars (US) to replace.\n\n==Trade unions==\nThe [[International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders, Blacksmiths, Forgers and Helpers]] is a [[trade union|labor union]]\n\n{{Metalworking navbox|cast|form|mach|smith|tool|weld}}\n[[Category:Metalworking occupations]]\n[[Category:Boilers]]\n[[Category:Boilermakers]]", "Millwright": "{{multiple issues|\n{{refimprove|date=July 2013}}\n{{Globalize |date = July 2010|discuss=Talk:Millwright#Globalize }}\n}}\n\nIn modern usage, a '''millwright''' is a [[Master craftsman|craftsman]] or [[tradesman]] engaged with the erection of machinery.  This includes such tasks as leveling, aligning and installing machinery on foundations or base plates and setting, leveling and aligning [[electric motor]]s or other power sources such as turbines with the equipment, which millwrights typically connect with some type of [[coupling]].  The exact duties of a millwright vary depending on whether they are unionized or not, with union rules typically being more restrictive than non-union situations, which may have their own [[job description]].  Related but distinctly different crafts include [[machinist]]s and [[mechanic]]s.\n\nHistorically, millwrights built [[watermill]]s and [[windmill]]s, mostly of wood with a limited number of metal parts.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last =Evans\n  | first =Oliver\n  | coauthors =Cadwallader Evans, Thomas Ellicott\n  | title =The young mill-wright and miller's guide, 12th edition\n  | publisher =Lea & Blanchard\n  | year = 1848\n  | pages =\n  | url =http://books.google.com/books?id=UEW7-CQPFoUC\n  }}</ref>\nMore generally in the English speaking world, early millwrights were specialist [[carpentry|carpenters]] who erected machines used in [[agriculture]], [[food processing]] and processing [[lumber]] and [[paper]].  In the early part of the [[Industrial Revolution]], their skills were pressed into service building the earliest powered [[textile mill]]s.\n\nModern millwrights work with [[steel]] and other materials and must often combine the skills of other mechanical trades in order to successfully install industrial machinery or to assemble machines from pre-fabricated parts.  Modern millwrights must also be able to read [[blueprints]] and other [[schematics]] to aid them in the construction of complex systems. Millwrights are frequently [[trade union|unionized]], with estimated numbers of around 45% in the US.<ref>http://www.unionstats.com/</ref>\n\n==History==\nA millwright originally was a specialized [[carpenter]] who had working knowledge of [[driveshaft]]s, [[bearing (mechanical)|bearing]]s, [[gearing]] and [[Belt (mechanical)|mechanical belts]] . The \"mill\" in millwright refers to the genesis of the trade in building [[flour mill]]s, [[sawmill]]s, [[papermill|paper mills]] and [[fulling|fulling mills]] powered by [[watermill|water]] or [[windmill|wind]].\n\nA number of prominent early-modern [[civil engineer]]s originally trained as millwrights, including [[James Brindley]], [[John Rennie (father)|John Rennie]] and [[William Fairbairn]].\n\n[[Oliver Evans]] was a prominent American millwright who published a manual for millwrights.\n\n==Responsibilities==\nA millwright today is someone who maintains, repairs or constructs industrial machinery for [[assembly line]]s, [[pumping station]]s and other [[utilities]], [[printer (publisher)|print shops]], [[steel mill]]s, [[oil refineries]], [[assembly plant]]s, mining, power stations,saw mills, pulp mills and other industries employing fixed heavy machinery.\n\n===General duties===\nMillwrights are usually responsible for the unassembled equipment when it arrives at the job site.  Using hoisting and moving equipment, they position the pieces that need to be assembled.  Their job requires a thorough knowledge of the load-bearing capabilities of the equipment they use as well as an understanding of blueprints and technical instructions.\n\nMillwrights must be able to read blueprints and schematic drawings to determine work procedures, to construct foundations for and to assemble, dismantle and overhaul machinery and equipment, using hand and power tools and to direct workers engaged in such endeavors. The use of lathes, milling machines and grinders may be required to make customized parts or repairs. In the course of work, millwrights are required to move, assemble and install machinery and equipment such as shafting, precision bearings, gear boxes, motors, mechanical clutches, conveyors, and tram rails, using hoists, pulleys, dollies, rollers, and trucks.\n\nMillwrights are also involved in routine tasks, such as lubrication of machinery, bearing replacement, seal replacement, cleaning of parts during an overhaul and preventative maintenance.\n\nMillwrights also must have a good understanding of [[fluid mechanics]] ([[hydraulics]] and [[pneumatics]]), and all of the components involved in these processes, such as [[valve]]s, cylinders, [[pump]]s and [[Gas compressor|compressors]].\n\nModern standards of practice for millwrights also require working within precise limits or standards of accuracy, at heights without fear; the use of logical step-by-step procedures in work; planning, solving problems and decision-making based on quantifiable information.\n\nMillwrights are trained to work with a wide array of precision tools, such as vernier calipers, micrometers, dial indicators, levels, gauge blocks, and optical and laser alignment tooling.\n\n===Areas of specialty===\nA typical job description for an industrial maintenance mechanic (millwright) often includes the primary purposes of installing, maintaining, upgrading and fabricating machinery and equipment according to layout plans, [[blueprints]], and other drawings in industrial establishment.\n\nMillwrights by nature of their profession have to be extremely well versed in many aspects of construction/demobilization.  They may install a [[conveyor]] system at an airport one week and the following week work at an [[Industrial wastewater treatment]] plant.\n\nMillwrights in the power generation industry assemble, set, [[wikt:align|align]] and balance [[turbines]]/[[rotor (turbine)|rotor]]s. Millwrights also perform critical lifts involving major components to be flown level at up to and within .005\u201d (5 thousandths of an inch). Because of their training and expertise, Millwrights are generally chosen to work on tasks associated with flying and setting heavy machinery.\n\nMillwrights are also in demand as teachers for vocational programs, both at the high school level and in post-secondary institutions. Many high schools feature fabrication courses that include metal work, where the experience of a qualified millwright is valuable. Often, these millwrights are paid a premium based on their years of field experience.\n\n===Training===\nMost millwrights are educated through [[apprenticeship]] programs where they receive a combination of classroom education along with a good deal of on-the-job training.  Most programs last about four years, and may include college degrees. Apprentices are usually paid a percentage of the average millwright's wage, and this percentage increases with experience.\n\nTraining courses received by a Union Millwright:{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n*[[Shaft alignment]] \n*[[Field machining]]\n*[[Rigging]]\n*[[Welding]]\n*[[Machining]]\n*[[Electrical wiring]]\n*[[Steel]] Fabrication\n*[[Conveyor]] systems\n*[[Steam Turbine]] installation\n*[[Gas turbine]] installation\n*[[Blueprint]] basic, intermediate and advanced\n*[[Safety]] basic, intermediate and advanced\n*[[Labor history (discipline)|Labor history]] \n*[[Associates degree]] classes\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Stationary engineer]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Metalworking navbox|machopen|tool}}\n\n[[Category:Woodworkers]]\n[[Category:Metalworkers]]\n[[Category:Construction trades workers]]", "Manager": "{{wiktionary|manager|manage}}\n{{wikiquote}}\n'''Manager''' or '''Manage''' may refer to:\n* [[Management]]\n** [[Manager (baseball)]], head coach of a professional baseball team\n** [[Manager (association football)]], for association football\n** [[Coach (sport)]], in other sports\n** [[Manager (professional wrestling)]], a fictional character\n** [[Talent manager]], for entertainers\n* [[Manage, Belgium]], a Walloon municipality in Hainaut, Belgium\n* [[Manager (Gaelic games)]], a coach of a Gaelic games team, most notably in Gaelic football and hurling\n* [[Manager (Mac OS)]], a component of the Mac OS operating system\n* ''[[Manager Daily]]'', a Thai newspaper\n\n== See also ==\n* [[General manager]], for managing both the revenue and cost elements of an organization\n* [[Project manager]], for individual projects\n* [[Branch (banking)]]\n* [[Managing director]]\n* [[Management (disambiguation)]]\n* {{lookfrom}}\n* {{intitle}}\n\n{{disambiguation}}\n\n[[de:Manager]]", "Patternmaker": "{{multiple issues|\n{{unreferenced|date=November 2013}}\n{{Underlinked|date=March 2014}}\n}}\n\nApparel '''patternmaker'''s draft patterns based on a designer's sketch of a style. The designer gives the sketch to the '''patternmaker''', who can ask questions to determine details the designer is looking for.\n\nPatterns may be drafted on paper or in a computer program designed for patternmaking. Most of the time, in modern American samplerooms, the patternmaker pulls an existing pattern (or block) and makes a modified copy of it to match the new style, either on paper or on computer. If it's a completely new style, the patternmaker will usually drape a rough draft in muslin fabric on a dress form, then show it to the designer to discuss any changes before transferring the markings to paper to create the pattern for cutting. Patterns may also be drafted from measurements, but this method has fallen out of use, as it's less accurate and takes longer than the other methods. Patternmakers are also asked to copy existing garments without damaging them. This is a common practice in American samplerooms.\n\nPatternmakers have a combination of engineering and design skill. They need to be able to understand what the designer wants, almost better than the designer, and know how to translate that into the lines of a pattern that will cause the garment to fit correctly. This ability to interpret the designer's ideal fit and flair is what sets great patternmakers apart from the masses and enables them to command high salaries. Being detail-oriented, style-conscious, perfectionist, and hard-working enable patternmakers to earn upwards of $100,000/year in New York or Los Angeles as of 2013. Freelance patternmakers can earn up to $40/hr or more in Los Angeles. Patternmaking services usually charge more than this, however.The time it takes to make any type of pattern is extremely difficult to predict, and few predictions are accurate.\n\nPatternmaking is taught in conjunction with fashion design education, as it is vital for designers to fully comprehend the apparel development process. It is also taught as a major at certain trade schools. There are many books on the subject, but it is rare for a patternmaker to become a professional through teaching oneself. Apprenticeships are almost unheard of in modern America, but would serve well to improve the transition from student to professional status. Because this occupation is relatively unknown outside of the apparel industry, there is a serious lack of patternmakers who can accurately interpret designs in Los Angeles, and possibly other fashion capitals.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Pattern (sewing)]]\n\n[[Category:Design]]\n[[Category:Fashion]]", "Heavy equipment operator": "{{Infobox Occupation\n| name           = Heavy equipment operator\n| image          = [[Image:US Navy 060324-5328N-N-324 Using a mini excavator, a heavy equipment operator with the Pittsburgh, Pa.-based, Dick Corp. carefully covers the remains of a wrecked wooden ship aboard Naval Air Station Pensacola.jpg|230px]]\n| caption        = A mini excavator uncovers the remains of a wooden ship\n| official_names = \n<!------------Details------------------->\n| type               = Vocation\n| activity_sector    = Construction\n| competencies       = | formation          = \n| employment_field   =\n| related_occupation = [[Driving|Driver]] \n| average_salary     = \n}}\n[[Image:Frontloaderorange.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A wheeled [[Loader (equipment)|front loader]] at work.
