{"Licensed behavior analyst": "{{over coverage|date=July 2010}}\nA '''licensed behavior analyst''' is a type of [[mental health]] [[professional]] in the United States. They have at least a master's degree, and sometimes a doctorate, in [[behavior analysis]] or a related field.<ref name=\"baojournal.com\">Cautilli, J.D., & Dziewolska, H. (2008).

It has two main branches: experimental and applied behavior analysis. The experimental analysis of behavior (EAB) is the basic science of this field and has over many decades accumulated a substantial and well-respected research literature. This literature provides the scientific foundation for applied behavior analysis (ABA), which is both an applied science that develops methods of changing behavior and a profession that provides services to meet diverse behavioral needs. Briefly, professionals in applied behavior analysis engage in the specific and comprehensive use of principles of learning, including [[operant]] and respondent learning, in order to address behavioral needs of widely varying individuals in diverse settings. Examples of these applications include: building the skills and achievements of children in school settings; enhancing the development, abilities, and choices of children and adults with different kinds of disabilities; and augmenting the performance and satisfaction of employees in organizations and businesses.\"</blockquote>\n\nAs the above suggests, [[behavior analysis]] is based on the principles of [[operant]] and [[respondent conditioning]]. This places [[behavior analysis]] as one of the dominant models of [[behavior modification]], [[behavior management]], [[behavioral engineering]] and [[behavior therapy]].  Behavior analysis is an active, environmental based approach and behavior analytic procedures are considered highly restrictive (see [[Least Restrictive Environment]]). For example, these service may make access to preferred items contingent on performance. This has led to abuses in the past, in particular where punishment programs have been involved.<ref>Cautilli, J.D., & Weinberg, M. (2007).Editorial: To license or not to license? That is the question:  Or, if we make a profession, will they come?''The Behavior Analyst Today, 8(1),'' 1\u20138.[http://www.baojournal.com/]</ref> In addition, failure to be an independent profession often leads behavior analysts and other behavior modifiers to have their ethical codes supplanted by those of other professions.<ref>Cautilli, J.D. & Weinberg, M. (2007). Editorial \u2013 Beholden To Other Professions. ''The Behavior Analyst Today, 8(2''), 111\u2013113. [http://www.baojournal.com/]</ref> For example, a behavior analyst working in the hospital setting might design a [[token economy]], a form of [[contingency management]]. He may desire to meet his ethical obligation to make the program habilitative and in the clients best long term interest. The physicians and nurses in the hospital who supervise him may decide that the [[token economy]] should instead create order in the nursing routines so clients get their medication quickly and efficiently. Instead of the ethical code of the Behavior Analysis Certification Board and the [[Association for Behavior Analysis]] International's position that those receiving treatment have a right to effective treatment<ref>[https://apps.abainternational.org/ABA/statements/treatment.asp ABA:I]</ref> and a right to effective education.<ref>[https://apps.abainternational.org/ABA/statements/education.asp ABA:I]</ref> In addition, failure on the part of a behavior analyst to adequately supervise his or her workers could lead to abuse.<ref>Bassett, J.

This certification is internationally recognized. This certification states the level of training and requires an exam to show a minimum level of [[competence (human resources)]] to call oneself a board certified behavior analyst. Certification came about because of many ethical issues with behavioral interventions being delivered including the use of aversive and humiliating treatments in the name of [[behavior modification]].<ref>Bailey, J.S. & Burch, M.R.

While the BACB certification means that candidates have satisfied entry-level requirements in behavior analytic training, certificants may require a government license for independent practice when treating behavioral health or medical problems. Licensed certificants must operate within the scope of their license and must practice within their areas of expertise. Where the government regulates behavior analytic services unlicensed certificants must be supervised by a licensed professional and operate within the scope of their supervisor\u2019s license when treating disorders. Unlicensed certificants who provide behavior analytic training for educational or optimal performance purposes do not require licensed supervision. Where the government does not regulate the treatment of medical or psychological disorders certificants should practice in accord with the laws of their state, province, or country. All certificants must practice within their personal areas of expertise.\n\n===Licensure===\nRecently, a move has occurred to license behavior analysts.<ref>[http://www.abapracticesig.org/pr01.htm Proposed Regulation<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>Cautilli, J.D., & Weinberg, M. (2007).Editorial: To license or not to license? That is the question:  Or, if we make a profession, will they come? ''The Behavior Analyst Today, 8(1),'' 1\u20138.[http://www.baojournal.com/]</ref> Licensure's purpose is to protect the public from employing underqualified or impaired practitioners<ref>Hassert,D.L, Kelly, A.N., Pritchard, J.K. & Cautilli, J.D. (2008). The Licensing of Behavior Analysts:\nProtecting the profession and the public . ''Journal of Early and Intensive Behavior Intervention,5(2),'' 8\u201319 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]</ref>\n\nThe model licensing act states that a person is a behavior analyst by training and experience.  The person seeking licensure must have mastered behavior analysis by achieving a masters degree in behavior analysis or related subject matter. Like all other master level licensed professions (see [[counseling]] and [[Licensed Professional Counselor]]) the model act sets the standard for a masters degree. This requirement states that the person has achieved textbook knowledge of behavior analysis which can be then tested through the exam offered by the Behavior Analyst Certification Board or the one offered by the World Center for Behavior Analysis. It also requires an internship in which a behavior analysts works under another master or Ph.D. level behavior analyst for a period of one year (750 hours) with at least two hours/week of supervision. Finally, those 750 hours are considered tutelage time. After that the behavior analyst must engage in supervised practice under a behavior analyst for a period of another 2 years (2,000 hours).\n\nOnce this process is complete the person applies to a state board who ensures that he or she has indeed met the above conditions.  Once the person is licensed public protection is still monitored by the licensing board, which makes sure that the person receives sufficient ongoing education, and the licensing board investigates ethical complaints. A licensed behavior analyst would have equal training, knowledge, skills and abilities in their discipline as would a [[mental health counselor]] or [[marriage and family therapist]] in their discipline. In February 2008, [[Indiana]], [[Arizona]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Vermont]], [[Oklahoma]] and other states now have legislation pending to create licensure for behavior analysts. [[Pennsylvania]] was the first state in 2008 to license \"behavior specialists\" to cover behavior analysts. Arizona, less than three weeks later, became the first state to license \"behavior analysts.\" Other states such as [[Nevada]] and [[Wisconsin]] also have passed behavior analytic licensure.\n\n==Other countries==\nRecently{{when?|date=October 2013}} licensure efforts have occurred in [[Canada]] for behavior analysts.\n\n==Professional organizations==\nThe [[Association for Behavior Analysis]] International has a special interest group for practitioner issues, which focuses on key issues related to licensing behavior analysts. In addition, they have a practice board and a policy board to handle legislative issues [http://www.abainternational.org/ ABA:I]. Finally, the Association has recently put out its own model licensing act for behavior analysts.\n\nAssociation for behavior analysis international serves as the core intellectual home for behavior analysts.<ref>Twyman, J.S.

In U.S., the exact title varies by state, but the other most frequently used title is ''licensed mental health counselor'' (LMHC).  Several U.S. states, including [[Illinois]], [[Maine]], and [[Tennessee]], have implemented a two-tier system whereby both the LPC and LMHC (or equivalent) are used. In those states higher tier professionals are granted the privilege to practice independently. However in most states LPC's or LMHC's may practice independently. Licensed Professional Counselors are one of the six types of licensed mental health professionals who provide psychotherapy in the United States.\n\nIn the United States, licensure as a licensed professional counselor occurs at the state level and requires a master's degree in counseling or a related field. In addition to their education, LPCs must obtain supervised clinical experience and must pass a state licensing exam. Different states require one of several different licensing examinations. Examples are the National Counselor Examination for Licensure and Certification (NCE) as well as the National Certified Mental Health Counselor Examination (NCMHCE). LPCs are regulated by federal and state laws, which either protect the title of LPC or LMHC or actually define the scope of practice of a professional counselor and stipulate certain client protections. If an LPC is also a member of a professional association or has received additional certifications, they must adhere to the codes of ethics of the professional association or certification body with which they have aligned.\n\n==Requirements for professional counselors==\n\n===United States===\nLPC (or variation, e.g. LCPC, LMHC, etc.) licensure is recognized in 50 states in the United States, as well as the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico.[http://www.counseling.org/Counselors/LicensureAndCert/TP/StateRequirements/CT2.aspx] The requirements vary from one jurisdiction to the next.  Most states require some combination of a master's degree, counseling experience and supervision, as well as passing a national examination, such as the National Counselor Examination (NCE) and/or the National Clinical Mental Health Counseling Examination (NCMHCE).<ref>http://ncmhce.org/licensure.htm</ref> Please review the National Board for Certified Counselors website for your state or jurisdiction's information:[http://www.nbcc.org/directory/Default.aspx]  \n\nIncluded below is a summary of requirements found in the state of Texas LPC board as an example.[http://www.dshs.state.tx.us/counselor/lpc_apply.shtm]  (Your state or jurisdiction's website will look different)\n\n\"A master's degree or doctoral degree in counseling or a related field.\n#Academic course work in each of the following areas: normal human growth and development; abnormal human behavior; appraisal or assessment techniques; counseling theories; counseling methods or techniques (individual and group); research; lifestyle and career development; social, cultural and family issues; and professional orientation.\n#As part of the graduate program, a supervised practicum experience that is primarily counseling in nature. The practicum should be at least 300 clock-hours with at least 100 clock-hours of direct client contact. Academic credit for the practicum must appear on the applicant's transcript.\n#After completion of the graduate degree and before application, an applicant must take and pass the National Counselor Exam and the Texas Jurisprudence Exam. After receiving a temporary LPC license from the board, the applicant may begin the supervised post-graduate counseling experience (internship). 3000 clock-hours with at least 1,500 being direct client contact of internship under the supervision of a board-approved supervisor is required. The 3000 clock-hours may not be completed in a time period of less than 18 months.\"\n\nClock hours and contact hours with clients needed to obtain licensure vary by state.  Other states, [[Oklahoma]] for example, require a 60-hour degree (versus the traditional 48-hour degree), and mandate at least 300 hours of internship prior to graduation  [http://www.ok.gov/health/documents/LPCActandRegulations.pdf OK Dept of Health]\n\nThe model of the LPC is based on the United States model for the regulation of professions. Each state is granted the privilege to regulate who may practice a particular profession and what the rights and responsibilities associated with that profession are. In most other countries, the Ministry of Education provides the authority to universities to grant licensure or a ''licenciatura'' upon completion of university studies. In these European-based regulation models, a license is granted for perpetuity and does not require renewal as is typical in the United States.\n\n===Canada===\nIn the Canadian province of [[Quebec]], the Ordre des conseillers et conseilleres d'orientation et psychoeducateurs et psychoeducatrices du Quebec (OCCOPPQ) grants counselor licensure. The [http://www.ccpa-accp.ca/en/memberbenefits/certification/ Canadian Counselling and Psychotherapy Association, CCPA] offers a distinct certification, Canadian Certified Counsellor (CCC) which is distinctly separate from the regular professional membership.\n\nThe [http://www.cpca-rpc.ca Canadian Professional Counsellors Association] (CPCA) is a national competency-based association that provides the designation of Registered Professional Counsellor (RPC) to its members.  Unlike degree-based associations, a specific degree level does not automatically qualify applicants for membership.  Instead, the CPCA requires core competencies in education and experience prior to taking a qualifying exam and undergoing psychological testing  as part of the membership application process.  Counsellors must then embark on a two year candidacy under the supervision of an approved Clinical Supervisor prior to becoming a full member.  The CPCA membership roles are a mixture of Diploma, Bachelor, Master, and PhD level degree holders, and its primary purpose is the protection of the public and the promotion of competency in the mental health profession in Canada.\n\n===China===\nThe Ministry of Labor and Human Resources grants counselor licensure.\n\n===Malaysia===\nIn [[Malaysia]], Lembaga Kaunselor Malaysia, grants counselor licensure.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of counseling topics]]\n* [[Mental health counselor]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Mental health professionals]]\n[[Category:Counseling]]", "School counselor": "A '''school counselor''' is a [[Wikt:counselor|counselor]] and an [[educator]] who works in elementary, middle, and high schools to provide academic, career, college readiness, and personal/social competencies to all K-12 students through a school counseling program.

It rarely exists at the elementary school level. Where there are federally funded secondary schools, there are some professionally trained school counselors. However, in many cases, there are only teachers who function as career masters/mistresses. School counselors often have teaching and other responsibilities that take time away from their school counseling tasks. The Counseling Association of Nigeria (CASSON) was formed in 1976 to promote the profession, but there is no code of ethics. However, a certification/licensure board has been formed. Aluede, Adomeh, & Afen-Akpaida (2004) discussed the overreliance on textbooks from the USA and the need for school counselors in Nigeria to take a whole-school approach and lessen the focus on individual approaches and honor the traditional African world view that values the family and community's roles in decision-making as paramount for effective decision-making in schools.<ref>Aluede, Adomeh, & Afen-Akpaida, 2004</ref>\n\n===Norway===\nNorway mandates school counseling.<ref name=\"counsellingminded.com\"/>\n\n===Oman===\nThere is some evidence of school counseling services at the high school level.<ref name=\"counsellingminded.com\"/>\n\n===Philippines===\nThe Philippines mandates school counseling in middle and high school.<ref name=\"counsellingminded.com\"/> The Congress of the Philippines passed the Guidance and Counseling Act of 2004, with a specific focus on Professional Practice, Ethics, National Certification, and the creation of a Regulatory Body, and specialists in school counseling are subject to this law.<ref>http://www.ops.gov.ph/records/ra_no9258.htm</ref>\n\n===Poland===\nSchool counseling was introduced in 1918 but disappeared during World War II.<ref name=\"counsellingminded.com\"/>\n\n===Portugal===\nPortugal mandates school counseling at the high school level.<ref name=\"counsellingminded.com\"/>\n\n===Romania===\nRomania mandates school counseling.<ref name=\"counsellingminded.com\"/>\n\n===Rwanda===\nSchool counseling has focused primarily on trauma-based counseling <ref name=\"counsellingminded.com\"/>\n\n===Saudi Arabia===\nSchool counseling is developing in Saudi Arabia with 90% of high schools having some type of school counseling services as of 2010.<ref name=\"counsellingminded.com\"/>\n\n===Serbia===\nSchool counseling is available only in certain schools.<ref name=\"counsellingminded.com\"/>\n\n===Singapore===\nSingapore mandates school counseling.<ref name=\"counsellingminded.com\"/>\n\n===Slovakia===\nSlovakia mandates school counseling.<ref name=\"counsellingminded.com\"/>\n\n===South Korea===\nIn South Korea, school counselors must teach a subject besides counseling, and not all school counselors are appointed to counseling positions, even though Korean law requires school counselors in all middle and high schools.<ref name=\"counsellingminded.com\"/><ref>Kim, Kay-Hyon, 2006</ref>\n\n===Spain===\nSpain provides school counseling at the high school level although it is unclear if it is mandated.<ref name=\"counsellingminded.com\"/>\n\n===St. Kitts===\nSt. Kitts mandates school counseling.<ref name=\"counsellingminded.com\"/>\n\n===Sweden===\nSweden mandates school counseling.<ref name=\"counsellingminded.com\"/>\n\n===Switzerland===\nSchool counseling is found at the high school level.<ref name=\"counsellingminded.com\"/>\n\n===Syria===\nSchool counseling has focused primarily on trauma-based counseling of students that prior to the war was done in schools but is now found in either in a school club or refugee camp sponsored and staffed by UNICEF.<ref name=\"counsellingminded.com\"/>\n\n===Taiwan===\nIn Taiwan, school counseling traditionally was done by \"guidance teachers.\" Recent advocacy by the Chinese Guidance and Counseling Association pushed for licensure for school counselors in Taiwan's public schools.

[[Jesse B. Davis]] was the first to provide a systematic school guidance program. In 1907, he became the principal of a high school and encouraged the school English teachers to use compositions and lessons to relate [[career interests]], develop character, and avoid behavioral problems. Many others during this time also focused on what is now called career development. For example, in 1908, [[Frank Parsons (school counselor)|Frank Parsons]], \"Father of Vocational Guidance\" established the [[Bureau of Vocational Guidance]] to assist young people in making the transition from school to work.\n\nFrom the 1920s to the 1930s, school [[counseling]]  grew because of the rise of progressive education in schools. This movement emphasized personal, social, moral development. Many schools reacted to this movement as anti-educational, saying that schools should teach only the fundamentals of education. This, combined with the economic hardship of the Great Depression, led to a decline in school counseling. In the 1940s, [[psychologists]] and [[Mental Health Counselor|counselors]] selected, recruited, and trained [[military]] personnel. This propelled the school counseling movement in schools by providing ways to test students and meet their needs. Schools accepted these military tests openly. Also, [[Carl Rogers]]' emphasis on helping relationships and a move away from directive \"guidance\" to nondirective or person-centered \"counseling\" influenced the profession of school counseling.\n\nIn the 1950s the [[government]] established the Guidance and Personnel Services Section in the Division of State and Local School Systems. In 1957, the [[Soviet Union]] launched [[Sputnik I]]. Out of concern that the [[Russians]] were winning the space race and that there were not enough [[scientists]] and [[mathematicians]], the government passed the [[National Defense Education Act]], spurring growth in [[vocational]] counseling through larger funding. In the 1960s, new [[legislation]] and professional developments refined the school counseling profession (Schmidt,<ref name=schmidt>Schmidt, J.J. (2003) ''Counseling in schools: Essential services and comprehensive programs''. 4th ed. Boston: Allyn & Bacon.</ref> 2003).\n\nThe 1960s was also a time of great federal funding for land grant colleges and universities in establishing Counselor Education programs.<ref>http://www.aces.org</ref> School counseling shifted from an exclusive focus on career development and added personal and social issues paralleling the rise of social justice and civil rights movements. In the early 1970s, Dr. Norm Gysbers began shifting the profession from school counselors as solitary professionals into having a comprehensive developmental school counseling program for all students K-12.<ref>Hatch & Bowers, 2003; ASCA, 2012\"</ref> He and his colleagues' research evidenced strong correlations between fully implemented school counseling programs and student academic success; a critical part of the evidence base for the profession based on their work in the state of Missouri.<ref>(Lapan, Gysbers, & Sun, 1997)</ref> Dr. Chris Sink & associates showed similar evidence-based success for school counseling programs at the elementary and middle school levels in Washington State.\n\nBut school counseling in the 1980s and early 1990s was absent from educational reform efforts.<ref name=\"Stone & Dahir, 2006\">(Stone & Dahir, 2006)</ref> The profession was facing irrelevance as the standards-based educational movement gained strength with little evidence of systemic effectiveness for school counselors. In response,<ref>Campbell & Dahir (1997)</ref> consulted with elementary, middle, and high school counselors and created the ASCA Student Standards with three core domains (Academic, Career, Personal/Social), nine standards, and specific competencies and indicators for K-12 students.<ref>Hatch & Bowers, 2003, 2005, 2012</ref> A year later, the first systemic meta-analysis of school counseling was published focused on outcome research in academic, career, and personal/social domains.<ref>(Whiston & Sexton, 1998)</ref>\n\nIn the late 1990s, a former mathematics teacher, school counselor, and administrator, Pat Martin, was hired by The Education Trust<ref name=\"edtrust.org\">(www.edtrust.org)</ref> to focus the school counseling profession on closing the achievement gap that harmed children and adolescents of color, poor and working class children and adolescents, bilingual children and adolescents and children and adolescents with disabilities. Martin developed focus groups of K-12 students, parents, guardians, teachers, building leaders, and superintendents, and interviewed professors of School Counselor Education. She hired a school counselor educator from Oregon State University, Dr. Reese House, and they co-created what emerged in 2003 as the National Center for Transforming School Counseling (NCTSC).<ref>http://www.edtrust.org</ref>\n\nThe NCTSC focused on both changing school counselor education at the graduate level and changing school counselor practice in local districts to teach school counselors how to prevent, intervene with, and close achievement and opportunity gaps. In the focus groups, they found what Hart & Jacobi<ref>Hart & Jacobi (1992)</ref> had indicated\u2014-too many school counselors were gatekeepers for the status quo instead of advocates for the academic success of every child and adolescent. Too many school counselors used inequitable practices, supported inequitable school policies, and were unwilling to change.\n\nThis professional behavior kept many students from non-dominant backgrounds (i.e., students of color, poor and working class students, students with disabilities, and bilingual students) from getting the rigorous coursework and academic, career, and college access skills needed to successfully graduate from high school and pursue post-secondary options including college. They funded six $500,000 grants for six Counselor Education/School Counseling programs, with a special focus on rural and urban settings, to transform their school counseling programs to include a focus on teaching school counselor candidates advocacy, leadership, teaming and collaboration, equity assessment using data, and culturally competent program counseling and coordination in 1998 (Indiana State University, University of Georgia, University of West Georgia, University of California-Northridge, University of North Florida, and Ohio State University) and then over 25 other Counselor Education/School Counseling programs joined as companion institutions in the following decade.<ref name=\"edtrust.org\"/> By 2008, NCTSC consultants had worked in over 100 school districts and major cities and rural areas to transform the work of school counselors.\n\nIn 2002, the American School Counselor Association released the first edition of the ASCA National Model: A framework for school counseling programs, written by Dr. Trish Hatch and Dr. Judy Bowers (2003),<ref>Hatch & Bowers, 2003; ASCA, 2012)</ref> comprising key school counseling components: the work of Drs. Norm Gysbers, Curly & Sharon Johnson, Robert Myrick, Carol Dahir & Cheri Campbell's ASCA National Standards, and the skill-based focus for closing achievement and opportunity gaps from the Education Trust's Pat Martin and Dr. Reese House into one document. In 2003, the Center for School Counseling Outcome Research and Evaluation (CSCORE)<ref name=\"Dimmitt, Carey, & Hatch, 2007\">(Dimmitt, Carey, & Hatch, 2007)</ref> was developed as a clearinghouse for evidence-based practice with regular research briefs disseminated and original research projects developed and implemented with founding director Dr. Jay Carey. One of the research fellows, Dr. Tim Poynton, developed the EZAnalyze<ref><http://www.ezanalyze.com></ref> software program for all school counselors to use as free-ware to assist in using data-based interventions and decision-making.\n\nIn 2004, the ASCA Ethical Standards for School Counselors was revised to focus on issues of equity, closing achievement and opportunity gaps, and ensuring all K-12 students received access to a school counseling program.<ref name=\"schoolcounselor.org\">(www.schoolcounselor.org)</ref> Also in 2004, Pat Martin moved to the College Board and hired School Counselor Educator Dr. Vivian Lee. They developed an equity-focused entity on school counselors' role in college readiness and admission counseling, the National Office for School Counselor Advocacy (NOSCA).<ref><http://professionals.collegeboard.com/policy-advocacy/educators/nosca></ref> NOSCA developed research scholarships for research on college counseling by K-12 school counselors and how it is taught in School Counselor Education programs.\n\nOn January 1, 2006, the USA Congress declared the first week of February National School Counseling Week, which grew out of advocacy from ASCA members.\n\nIn 2008, the first NOSCA study was released by Dr. Jay Carey and colleagues focused on innovations in selected College Board \"Inspiration Award\" schools where school counselors collaborated inside and outside their schools for high college-going rates and strong college-going cultures in schools with large numbers of students of non-dominant backgrounds.<ref>(College Board, 2008)</ref> In 2008, ASCA released School Counseling Competencies focused on assisting school counseling programs to effectively implement the ASCA Model.<ref name=\"schoolcounselor.org\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Hatch & Bowers, 2003; ASCA, 2012</ref>\n \nAlso in 2008, in support of the ASCA Model and new vision<ref>{{cite web|author=Schellenberg |url=http://www.thenewschoolcounselor.com |title=Home |publisher=Thenewschoolcounselor.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref> school counseling, Dr. Rita Schellenberg introduced ''standards blending'' as a cross-walking approach to align school counseling with the academic achievement mission of schools as well as two data-based reporting systems, SCORE and SCOPE.<ref>Schellenberg, R.

The study shared school counselors' views on educational policies, practices, and reform, and how many of them, especially in urban and rural school settings, are not given the chance to focus on what they were trained to do, especially career and college access counseling and readiness for all students, in part due to high caseloads and inappropriate tasks that take up too much of their time. School counselors made strong suggestions about their crucial role in accountability and success for all students and how school systems need to change so that school counselors can be key players in student success. Implications for public policy and district and school-wide change are addressed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nosca.collegeboard.org/research-policies/annual-survey |title=NOSCA Annual Survey - College Board - Advocacy &#124; NOSCA: National Office for School Counselor Advocacy |publisher=Nosca.collegeboard.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref> The National Center for Transforming School Counseling at The Education Trust released a brief, ''Poised to Lead: How School Counselors Can Drive Career and College Readiness,'' challenging all schools to utilize school counselors for equity and access for rigorous courses for all students and ensuring college and career access skills and competencies be a major focus of the work of school counselors K-12.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edtrust.org/dc/press-room/press-release/school-counselors-underutilized-on-secondary-campuses |title=School counselors underutilized on secondary campuses &#124; Education Trust |publisher=Edtrust.org |date=2011-12-19 |accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, the CSCORE assisted in evaluating and publishing six statewide research studies assessing the effectiveness of school counseling programs based on statewide systemic use of school counseling programs such as the ASCA National Model and their outcomes in ''Professional School Counseling.''<ref name=\"Carey 2012\">(Carey & Dimmitt, 2012; Lapan, 2012)</ref> Research indicated strong correlational evidence between lower school counseling ratios and better student success academically, in terms of career and college access/readiness/admission, and for various personal/social issues including school safety, reduced disciplinary issues, and better attendance in schools with fully implemented school counseling programs.<ref name=\"Carey 2012\"/>\n\nAlso in 2012, the American School Counselor Association released the third edition of the ASCA National Model.<ref>ASCA, 2012, [http://www.ascanationalmodel.org/content.asp?contentid=54 \"The ASCA National Model -- New Edition Released\"] Retrieved August 20, 2012.</ref> Also, the National Center for Transforming School Counseling (NCTSC) created a School Counselor Educator Coalition to further transform graduate School Counselor Education programs in the new vision of school counseling for K-12 school counselors. Twenty universities were represented and four School Counselor Educator faculty mentors were named: Dr. Carolyn Stone, University of North Florida, Dr. Trish Hatch, San Diego State University, Dr. Stuart Chen-Hayes, City University of New York/Lehman College, and Dr. Erin Mason, DePaul University.\n\nIn 2013, Northern Kentucky University and the Center for School Counseling Outcome Research and Evaluation (CSCORE) launched an annual Evidence-Based School Counseling Conference with specific strands for school counselors, building and district leaders, and school counselor educators <ref>http://coehs.nku.edu/centers/nkcee/center_at_work/profdevinitiatives/EBSCConference.html</ref>\n\n===Venezuela===\nSchool counseling is mandated in Venezuela and it has focused on cultural competency.<ref name=\"counsellingminded.com\"/>\n\n===Vietnam===\nSchool counseling is mandated in Vietnam.<ref name=\"counsellingminded.com\"/>\n\n==Roles, school counseling programs, associations, and ethics==\nProfessional school counselors ideally implement a school counseling program that promotes and enhances student achievement (Hatch & Bowers, 2003, 2005; ASCA, 2012).<ref name=\"Hatch 2003\">Hatch & Bowers, 2003, 2005; ASCA, 2012</ref>\nA framework for appropriate and inappropriate school counselor responsibilities and roles is outlined in the ASCA National Model (Hatch & Bowers, 2003, 2005; ASCA, 2012).<ref name=\"Hatch & Bowers, 2003, 2005; ASCA, 2012\"/> School counselors, in most USA states, usually have a Master's degree in school counseling from a Counselor Education graduate program. In Canada, they must be licensed teachers with additional school counseling training and focus on academic, career, and personal/social issues. China requires at least three years of college experience. In Japan, school counselors were added in the mid-1990s, part-time, primarily focused on behavioral issues. In Taiwan, they are often teachers with recent legislation requiring school counseling licensure focused on individual and group counseling for academic, career, and personal issues. In Korea, school counselors are mandated in middle and high schools.\n\nSchool counselors are employed in elementary, middle, and high schools, and in district supervisory settings and in counselor education faculty positions (usually with an earned Ph.D. in Counselor Education in the USA or related graduate doctorates abroad), and post-secondary settings doing academic, career, college readiness, and personal/social counseling, consultation, and program coordination. Their work includes a focus on developmental stages of student growth, including the needs, tasks, and student interests related to those stages(Schmidt,<ref name=schmidt/> 2003).\n\nProfessional school counselors meet the needs of student in three basic domains: [[academic development]], [[career development]], and [[personal/social development]] (Dahir & Campbell, 1997; Hatch & Bowers, 2003, 2005; ASCA, 2012) with an increased emphasis on college access.<ref>(Carey et al., 2008)</ref>  Knowledge, understanding and skill in these domains are developed through [[classroom]] [[teaching|instruction]], [[appraisal]],{{Disambiguation needed|date=June 2011}} [[wikt:consultation|consultation]], [[psychotherapy|counseling]], [[:wikt:coordination|coordination]], and [[collaboration]].  For example, in appraisal, school counselors may use a variety of [[personality tests|personality]] and career assessment methods (such as the<ref>Self-Directed Search (SDS)</ref> or<ref>Career Key</ref> (based on the<ref>Holland Codes</ref>) to help students explore career and college needs and interests.\n\nSchool counselor interventions include individual and group counseling for some students.  For example, if a student's behavior is interfering with his or her achievement, the school counselor may observe that student in a class, provide consultation to teachers and other stakeholders to develop (with the student) a plan to address the behavioral issue(s), and then collaborate to implement and evaluate the plan. They also provide consultation services to family members such as college access, career development, parenting skills, study skills, child and adolescent development, and help with school-home transitions.\n\nSchool counselor interventions for all students include annual academic/career/college access planning K-12 and leading classroom developmental lessons on academic, career/college, and personal/social topics.  The topics of [[character education]], diversity and multiculturalism (Portman, 2009), and school safety are important areas of focus for school counselors. Often school counselors will coordinate outside groups that wish to help with student needs such as academics, or coordinate a program that teaches about [[child abuse]] or [[psychoactive drug|drugs]], through on-stage [[drama]] (Schmidt,<ref name=schmidt/> 2003).\n\nSchool counselors develop, implement, and evaluate school counseling programs that deliver academic, career, college access, and personal/social competencies to all students in their schools. For example, the ASCA National Model (Hatch & Bowers, 2003, 2005; ASCA, 2012)<ref name=\"Hatch 2003\"/> includes the following four main areas:\n\n* Foundation - a school counseling program mission statement, a beliefs/vision statement, SMART Goals; ASCA Student Standards & ASCA Code of Ethics;\n* Delivery System - how school counseling core curriculum lessons, planning for every student, and individual and group counseling are delivered in direct and indirect services to students (80% of school counselor time);\n* Management System - calendars; use of data tool; use of time tool; administrator-school counselor agreement; advisory council; small group, school counseling core curriculum, and closing the gap action plans; and\n* Accountability System - school counseling program assessment; small group, school counseling core curriculum, and closing-the-gap results reports; and school counselor performance evaluations based on school counselor competencies.\n\nThe model (ASCA, 2012) is implemented using key skills from the Education Trust's Transforming School Counseling Initiative:  Advocacy, Leadership, Teaming and Collaboration, and Systemic Change.<ref name=\"edtrust.org\"/>\n\nSchool Counselors around the world are affiliated with national and regional school counseling associations including: Asociacion Argentina de Counselors (AAC-Argentina), American Counseling Association (ACA-USA), African Counseling Association (AfCA), American School Counselor Association (ASCA-USA), Associacao Portuguesa de Psicoterapia centrada na Pessoa e de Counselling (APPCPC-Portugal), Australian Guidance and Counselling Association (AGCA), British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP-UK), Canadian Counseling Association (CCA)/Association Canadienne de Counseling (ACC), Center for Excellence in School Counseling and Leadership(CESCaL) (USA), Center for School Counseling Outcome Research (CSCOR-USA) Council for the Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP-USA and international), Counselling Children and Young People (BACP affiliate, UK), Counseling & Psychotherapy in Scotland (COSCA), Cypriot Association of School Guidance Counsellors (OELMEK), European Counseling Association (ECA), France Ministry of Education, Federacion Espanola de Orientacion y Psicopedagogia (FEOP-Spain), Department of Education-Malta,  Hellenic Society of Counselling and Guidance (HESCOG-Greece), Hong Kong Association of Guidance Masters and Career Masters (HKAGMCM), Institute of Guidance Counselors (IGC) (Ireland), International Association for Educational and Vocational Guidance (IAEVG)/Association Internationale d'Orientation Scolaire et Professionnelle (AIOSP)/ Internationale Vereinigung f\u00fcr Schul- und Berufsberatung (IVSBB)/Asociaci\u00f3n Internacional para la Orientaci\u00f3n Educativa y Profesional(AIOEP), International Baccalaureate (IB), International Vanguard of Counsellors (IVC),  Kenya Association of Professional Counselors (KAPC), National Board for Certified Counselors (NBCC, USA), National Center for Transforming School Counseling (NCTSC) at The Education Trust (USA), National Office for School Counselor Advocacy (NOSCA) at The College Board (USA),\nNew Zealand Association of Counsellors/Te Roopu Kaiwhiriwhiri o Aotearoa (NZAC), Counseling Association of Nigeria (CASSON),\nPhilippine Guidance and Counseling Association (PGCA), Overseas Association of College Admissions Counselors (OACAC, an affiliate of National Association of College Admissions Counselors-USA), Singapore Association for Counseling (SAC), and the Taiwan Guidance and Counseling Association (TGCA).<ref>http://www.aacounselors.org.ar/, www.counseling.org,  www.oocities.com/Athens/Crete/1919/, www.schoolcounselor.org, www.appcpc.com/, www.agca.com.au/, www.bacp.co.uk/, www.ccacc.ca/home.html,\n/www.cescal.org/index.cfm, www.umass.edu/schoolcounseling/, www.cacrep.org, www.ccyp.co.uk/, www.cosca.org.uk/, www.symvoulevein.com, www.eacnet.org/prospectus.html, www.education.gouv.fr/cid160/lieux-information.html, www.uned.es/feop-reop/index.htm, http://schoolnet.gov.mt/guidance/default.html, www.elesyp.gr/, www.hkacmgm.org/, www.igc.ie/, www.iaevg.org/,\nwww.ibo.org/, www.vanguardofcounsellors.org/, www.kapc.or.ke/, www.nbcc.org, www.edtrust.org, http://professionals.collegeboard.com/policy-advocacy/educators/nosca, www.nzac.org.nz/, www.cassonng.org/, www.pgca.org.ph/index.shtml, http://new.oacac.com/, www.sac-counsel.org.sg/, www.guidance.org.tw/internation.html</ref>\n\nSchool Counselors are expected to follow a professional code of ethics in many countries.

In addition, CACREP tightened the school counseling standards with specific evidence needed for how school counseling students receive education in foundations; counseling prevention and intervention; diversity and advocacy; assessment; research and evaluation; academic development; collaboration and consultation; and leadership in K-12 school counseling contexts.<ref>(CACREP, 2009)</ref>\n\nCertification practices for school counselors vary around the world. School counselors in the USA may opt for national certification through two different boards. The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS) requires a two-to-three year process of performance based assessment, and demonstrate (in writing) content knowledge in human growth/development, diverse populations, school counseling programs, theories, data, and change and collaboration.<ref>(www.nbpts.org)</ref> As of February, 2005, 30 states offer financial incentives for this certification.\n\nAlso in the USA, The National Board for Certified Counselors (NBCC) requires passing the National Certified School Counselor Examination (NCSC), including 40 multiple choice questions and seven simulated cases assessing school counselors' abilities to make critical decisions.  Additionally, a master's degree and three years of supervised experience are required. NBPTS also requires three years of experience, however state certification is required (41 of 50 states require a master's degree). At least four states offer financial incentives for the NCSC certification.<ref>Mcleod, K. (March/April 2005).</ref><ref>Schellenberg, R. (2008).

School counselors working in international schools or \"American\" schools globally may find similar work environments and expectations to the USA. School counselor pay varies based on school counselor roles, identity, expectations, and legal and certification requirements and expectations of each country. According to the Occupational Outlook Handbook (OOH), the [[median]] [[salary]] for school counselors in the USA in 2010 was (USD) $53,380 or $25.67 hourly. The USA has 267,000 employees in titles such as School Counselor or related titles in education and advising and college and career counseling. The projected growth for school counselors is 14-19% or faster than average than other occupations in the USA with a predicted 94,000 job openings from 2008-2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oes/ |title=Occupational Employment Statistics Home Page |publisher=Bls.gov |date=2012-03-27 |accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/emp/ |title=Employment Projections Home Page |publisher=Bls.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref> \"  In Australia, a survey by the Australian Guidance and Counseling Association found that school counselor salary ranged from (AUD) the high 50,000s to the mid 80,000s.\n\nAmong all counseling specialty areas, public elementary, middle and high school counselors are (2009) paid the highest salary on average of all counselors. Budget cuts, however, have affected placement of public school counselors in Canada, Ireland, the United States, and other countries due to the global recession in recent years. In the United States, rural areas and urban areas traditionally have been under-served by school counselors in public schools due to both funding shortages and often a lack of best practice models. With the advent of No Child Left Behind legislation in the USA and a mandate for school counselors to be working with data and showing evidence-based practice, school counselors able to show and share results in assisting to close gaps are in the best position to argue for increased school counseling resources and positions for their programs (Hatch & Bowers, 2003, 2005; ASCA, 2012).<ref name=\"Hatch 2003\"/>\n\n==Notable school counselors ==\n* [[Fernando Cabrera]] USA politician\n* [[Ern Condon]], Canadian politician \n* [[Derrick Dalley]], Canadian politician \n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Gendron]], Canadian politician\n* [[Steve Lindberg]], USA politician\n* [[Lillian Ortiz-Self]]}, USA politician\n* [[Tony Resch]], USA lacrosse player\n* [[Tom Tillberry]],  USA politician\n* [[Tom Villa]], USA politician\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Education}}\n* [[Academic counseling]]\n* [[Achievement gaps]]\n* [[Advocacy]]\n* [[Attainment gaps]]\n* [[Career counseling]]\n* [[Career development]]\n* [[Character education]]\n* [[College admissions counseling]]\n* [[Counseling]]\n* [[Counselor (disambiguation)]]\n* [[Counselor Education]]\n* [[Education]]\n* [[Educational equity]]\n* [[Educational leadership]]\n* [[Frank Parsons (school counselor)|Frank Parsons]]\n* [[List of counseling topics]]\n* [[Mental health counseling]]\n* [[Multicultural counseling]]\n* [[Multicultural education]]\n* [[Opportunity gaps]]\n* [[Personal/social counseling]]\n* [[Play therapy]]\n* [[School social worker]]\n* [[School psychology]]\n* [[Social justice]]\n* [[Teacher]]\n\n==References==\n<!-- this 'empty' section displays references defined elsewhere -->\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n==Evidence- and research-based school counseling articles, books, DVDs==\n\n=== Abilities, Disabilities, Gifts, Talents, and Special Education in School Counseling ===\n\n*Bauman, S.

A psychiatrist specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of [[mental disorder]]s. Psychiatrists are [[medical doctor]]s who must evaluate patients to determine whether or not their symptoms are the result of a physical illness, a combination of physical and mental, or a strictly [[psychiatric]] one. As part of the clinical assessment process they may employ a [[mental status examination]], a [[physical examination]], [[brain imaging]] such as [[computerized tomography]]  (CT/CAT scan), [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), and [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) scanning, and [[blood testing]]. Psychiatrists prescribe medicine, and may also use [[psychotherapy]], although the vast majority do medical management and refer to a [[psychologist]] or another specialized therapist for weekly to bi-monthly psychotherapy.\n\n== Subspecialties ==\nThe field of psychiatry has many subspecialties (also known as Fellowships) that require additional training which are certified by the\u00a0American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology (ABPN) and require Maintenance of Certification Program (MOC) to continue. The following include: \n* [[Clinical neurophysiology]]\n* [[Forensic psychiatry]]\n* [[Addiction psychiatry]]\n* [[Brain Injury Medicine]]\n* [[Child and Adolescent Psychiatry]]\n* [[Geriatric psychiatry]]\n* [[Hospice and palliative medicine]]\n* [[Pain management]]\n* [[Psychosomatic medicine]]( also known as [[Liaison psychiatry|Consultation-liaison psychiatry]])\n* [[Sleep medicine]]\nFurther, other specialties that exist include: <ref name=\"UKReq\" />\n* [[Cross-cultural psychiatry]]\n* [[Emergency psychiatry]]\n* [[Learning disability]]\n* [[Neurodevelopmental disorder]]\n* [[Cognition]] diseases as in various forms of [[dementia]]\n\nSome psychiatrists specialize in helping certain age groups. [[Pediatric psychiatry]] is the area of the profession working with children in addressing psychological problems.<ref name=UKReq /> Psychiatrists specializing in [[geriatric psychiatry]] work with the elderly and are called geriatric psychiatrists or geropsychiatrists.<ref name=UKReq />  Those who practice psychiatry in the workplace are called occupational psychiatrists in the united states and occupational psychology is the name used for the most similar discipline in the UK.<ref name=UKReq /> Psychiatrists working in the courtroom and reporting to the judge and jury, in both criminal and civil court cases, are called [[forensic psychiatrist]]s, who also treat mentally disordered offenders and other patients whose condition is such that they have to be treated in secure units.<ref name=UKReq /><ref name=ABPNSubSpecial />\n\nOther psychiatrists and mental health professionals in the field of psychiatry may also specialize in [[psychopharmacology]], [[psychotherapy]], [[psychiatric genetics]], [[neuroimaging]], [[dementia]]-related disorders/ sicknesses as [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]], [[sleep medicine]], [[pain medicine]], [[palliative medicine]], [[eating disorder]]s, [[sexual disorders]], [[women's health]], [[Global Mental Health]], [[early intervention in psychosis|early psychosis intervention]], [[mood disorders]] and [[anxiety disorders]] (including [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] and [[post-traumatic stress disorder]]).<ref name=UKReq /><ref name=ABPNSubSpecial>American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology, Inc.

Retrieved March 25, 2007, from http://www.psychiatry.com/student.php</ref>\n\n===US and Canada===\nIn the [[U.S.]] and [[Canada]] one must first attain the degree of [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] or [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|D.O.]], followed by practice as a [[Residency (medicine)|psychiatric resident]] for another four years (five years in Canada). This extended period involves comprehensive training in psychiatric diagnosis, psychopharmacology, medical care issues, and psychotherapies.  All accredited psychiatry residencies in the United States require proficiency in [[cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive-behavioral]], brief, psychodynamic, and supportive psychotherapies.  Psychiatry residents are required to complete at least four post-graduate months of internal medicine or pediatrics, plus a minimum of two months of neurology during their first year of residency, referred to as an \"internship\".<ref name=USReq /> After completing their training, psychiatrists are eligible to take a specialty board examination to become board-certified.<ref name=USReq />  The total amount of time required to complete educational and training requirements in the field of psychiatry in the United States is 12 years after high school. Subspecialists in child and adolescent psychiatry are required to complete a two-year fellowship program, the first year of which can run concurrently with the fourth year of the general psychiatry residency program. This adds one to two years of training.\n\n===United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland===\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], psychiatrists must hold a medical degree.<ref>[http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/training/careersinpsychiatry/careerinfoforschoolleavers.aspx Careers info for School leavers<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  These degrees are often abbreviated [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery|MB BChir, MB BCh, MB ChB, BM BS, or MB BS]].  Following this, the individual will work as a [[Foundation House Officer]] for two additional years in the UK, or one year as [[Intern]] in the Republic of Ireland to achieve registration as a basic medical practitioner. Training in psychiatry can then begin and it is taken in two parts: three years of Basic Specialist Training culminating in the MRCPsych exam followed by three years of Higher Specialist Training, referred to as \"ST4-6\" in the UK and \"Senior Registrar Training\" in the Republic of Ireland. Candidates with MRCPsych degree and complete basic training must reinterview for higher specialist training. At this stage, the development of speciality interests such as forensic, child/adolescent take place. At the end of 3 years of higher specialist training, candidates are awarded a CCT (UK) or CCST (Ireland), both meaning Certificate of Completion of (Specialist) Training. At this stage, the psychiatrist can register as a specialist and the qualification of CC(S)T is recognized in all EU/EEA states. As such, training in the UK and Ireland is considerably longer than in the US or Canada and frequently takes around 8\u20139 years following graduation from medical school. Those with a CC(S)T will be able to apply for Consultant posts. Those with training from outside the EU/EEA should consult local medical boards to review their qualifications and eligibility for equivalence recognition (for example, those with a US residency and ABPN qualification).\n\n===Netherlands===\nIn the [[Netherlands]] one must complete [[Medical_school#Netherlands_and_Belgium|medical school]] after which one is certified as a medical doctor. After a strict selection program one can specialize in psychiatry: a 4.5 year specialization. During this specialization, the resident has to do a 6-month residency in the field of social psychiatry, a 12-month residency in a field of their own choice (which can be child psychiatry, forensic psychiatry, somatic medicine or medical research).  To become an adolescent psychiatrist, one has to do an extra specialization period of 2 more years. In short this means that it takes at least 10.5 years of study to become a psychiatrist which can go up to 12.5 years if one becomes a children's and adolescent psychiatrist.\n\n== See also ==\n{{columns\n|width = 22em\n|col1 =\n*[[List of famous figures in psychiatry]]\n*[[List of psychiatrists]]\n*[[Medicine]]\n|col2 =\n*[[Mental health]]\n*[[Mental health professional]]\n*[[Mental illness]]\n|col3 =\n*[[Psychiatry]]\n*[[Psychiatric nursing]]\n*[[Clinical psychology]]\n*[[Psychologist]]\n*[[Psychology]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* American Psychiatric Association.

Because mental health covers a wide range of elements, the scope of practice greatly varies between professionals.  Some professionals may enhance relationships while others treat specific mental disorders and illness.  Often, as with the case of psychiatrists and psychologists, the scope of practice may overlap.\n\nMost qualified mental health professionals will refer a [[patient]] or [[wiktionary:Client|client]] to another professional if the specific type of [[Mental illness#Treatment|treatment]] needed is outside of their scope of practice. Additionally, many mental health professionals may sometimes work together using a variety of treatment options such as concurrent [[psychiatric medication]] and [[psychotherapy]].  Additionally, specific mental health professionals may be utilized based upon their cultural and religious background or experience.\n\nIncreasingly, primary care providers, such as internists, pediatricians, and family physicians, provide many initial components of mental health diagnosis and treatment for children and adults.  In particular, family physicians are trained during residency in interviewing and diagnostic skills, and may be quite skilled in managing conditions such as [[ADHD]] in children and [[Depression (mood)|depression]] in adults. Likewise, many (but not all) pediatricians may be taught the basic components of ADHD diagnosis and treatment during residency. In many other circumstances, primary care physicians may receive additional training and experience in mental health diagnosis and treatment during their practice years.\n\n==Psychiatrist==\n{{Main|Psychiatrist|Psychiatry}}\nPsychiatrists are [[physician]]s and one of the few professionals in the mental health industry who specialize and are certified in treating [[mental illness]] using the biomedical approach to mental disorders including the use of [[Psychiatric medications|medications]].\n\nPsychiatrists may also go through significant training to conduct [[psychotherapy]] and [[Cognitive therapy|cognitive behavioral therapy]]; however psychologists and clinical psychologists specialize in the research and clinical application of these techniques.  The amount of training a psychiatrist holds in providing these types of therapies varies from program to program and also differs greatly based upon region.\n\n===Specialties of psychiatrists===\nAs part of their evaluation of the patient, psychiatrists are one of only a few mental health professionals who may conduct physical examinations, order and interpret laboratory tests and [[EEG]]s, and may order brain imaging studies such as [[Computed tomography|CT]] or [[Computed tomography|CAT]], [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]], and [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] scanning. A medical professional must evaluate the patient for any medical problems or diseases that may be the cause of the mental illness.\n\nHistorically psychiatrists have been the only mental health professional with the power to prescribe medication to treat specific types of mental illness. Currently, [[Physician Assistant]]s and [[nurse practitioner|advanced practice psychiatric nurses]] may prescribe medications, including [[psychiatric medication]]s. Clinical psychologists have gained the ability to prescribe psychiatric medications on a limited basis in a few U.S. states after completing additional training and passing an examination.\n\n===Educational requirements for psychiatrists===\nTypically the requirements to become a psychiatrist are substantial but differ from country to country.<ref name=UKReq>The Royal College of Psychiatrists.

Psychiatry residents are required to complete at least four post-graduate months of internal medicine (pediatrics may be substituted for some or all of the internal medicine months for those planning to specialize in child and adolescent psychiatry) and two months of neurology, usually during the first year,<ref name=USReq /> but some programs require more. Occasionally, some prospective psychiatry residents will choose to do a transitional year internship in medicine or general surgery, in which case they may complete the two months of neurology later in their residency. After completing their training, psychiatrists take written and then oral specialty board examinations.<ref name=USReq />  The total amount of time required to qualify in the field of psychiatry in the United States is typically 4 to 5 years after obtaining the MD or DO (or in total 8 to 9 years minimum). Many psychiatrists pursue an additional 1\u20132 years in subspecialty fellowships on top of this such as child psychiatry, geriatric psychiatry, and psychosomatic medicine.\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Republic of Ireland]], and most Commonwealth countries, the initial degree is the combined [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery|Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery]],<ref name=UKReq /> usually a single period of academic and clinical study lasting around five years. This degree is most often abbreviated 'MBChB', 'MB BS' or other variations, and is the equivalent of the American 'MD'. Following this the individual must complete a two-year foundation programme<ref name=UKReq /> that mainly consists of supervised paid work as a [[Foundation House Officer]] within different specialties of medicine.<ref>[http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/specialtytraining/students/trainingpathways/foundationtraining.aspx RCP - Foundation Training]</ref> Upon completion the individual can apply for \"core specialist training\" in psychiatry, which mainly involves supervised paid work as a [[Specialty Registrar]] in different subspecialities of psychiatry.<ref>[http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/specialtytraining/students/trainingpathways/coretraining.aspx RCP - Core Training]</ref> After three years there is an examination for Membership of the [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]] (abbreviated [[MRCPsych]]), with which an individual may then work as a \"[[Staff grade]]\" or \"[[Associate Specialist]]\" psychiatrist, or pursue an academic psychiatry route via a [[PhD]].<ref>[http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/specialtytraining/careersinpsychiatry/careersinfoforugs.aspx RCP - Careers Info]</ref> If, after the MRCPsych, an additional 3 years of specialization known as \"advanced specialist training\" are taken (again mainly paid work), and a [[Certificate of Completion of Training]] is awarded, the individual can apply for a post taking independent clinical responsibility as a \"[[Consultant (medicine)|consultant]]\" psychiatrist.<ref>[http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/specialtytraining/students/trainingpathways/highertraining.aspx RCP - Higher Training]</ref>\n\n==Clinical psychologist==\n{{Main|Clinical psychology}}\nA clinical psychologist studies and applies [[psychology]] for the purpose of understanding, preventing, and relieving psychologically-based distress or dysfunction and to promote subjective well-being and personal development. In many countries it is a regulated profession that addresses moderate to more severe or chronic psychological problems, including diagnosable [[mental illness|mental disorders]]. Clinical psychology includes a wide range of practices, such as research, psychological assessment, teaching, consultation, forensic testimony, and program development and administration. Central to clinical psychology is the practice of [[psychotherapy]], which uses a wide range of techniques to change thoughts, feelings, or behaviors in service to enhancing subjective well-being, mental health, and life functioning. Unlike other mental health professionals, psychologists are trained to conduct [[psychological assessment]]. Clinical psychologists can work with individuals, couples, children, older adults, families, small groups, and communities.\n\n===Specialties of clinical psychologists===\nClinical psychologists who focus on treating mental health specialize in evaluating patients and providing psychotherapy. The do not prescribe medication as this is a role of a psychiatrist (physician who specializes in psychiatry). There are a wide variety of therapeutic techniques and perspectives that guide practitioners, although most fall into the major categories of [[Psychodynamic psychotherapy|Psychodynamic]], [[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy|Cognitive Behavioral]], [[existential psychotherapy|Existential]]-[[Humanistic psychology|Humanistic]], and [[Systemic Therapy|Systems Therapy]] (e.g. [[Family therapy|family]] or couples therapy).\n\nIn addition to therapy, clinical psychologists are also trained to administer and interpret psychological personality tests such as the [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory|MMPI]] and the [[Rorschach inkblot test]], and various standardized tests of intelligence, memory, and [[Neuropsychology|neuropsychological]] functioning. Common areas of specialization include: [[Mental illness|specific disorders]] (e.g. [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] or  [[Clinical depression|depression]]), [[Clinical neuropsychology|neuropsychological disorders]], [[Child psychopathology|child and adolescent]], [[Family therapy|family]] and [[relationship counseling]]. Internationally, psychologists are generally not granted prescription privileges. In the US, [[Prescriptive authority for psychologists movement|prescriptive rights]] have been granted to appropriately trained psychologists only in the states of New Mexico and Louisiana, with some limited prescriptive rights in Indiana and the US territory of Guam.<ref name=Prescribing/>\n\n===Educational requirements for clinical psychologists===\nClinical psychologists, having completed an [[undergraduate degree]] usually in psychology or other [[social science]], generally undergo specialist postgraduate training lasting at least two years (e.g. Australia), three years (e.g. UK), or four to six years depending how much research activity is included in the course (e.g. US). In countries where the course is of shorter duration, there may be an informal requirement for applicants to have undertaken prior work experience supervised by a clinical psychologist, and a proportion of applicants may also undertake a separate [[PhD]] research degree.\n\nToday, in the U.S., about half of licensed psychologists are trained in the [[Scientist-Practitioner Model of Clinical Psychology]] (PhD)\u2014a model that emphasizes both research and clinical practice and is usually housed in universities. The other half are being trained within a [[Psy.D.|Practitioner-Scholar Model of Clinical Psychology]] (PsyD), which focuses on practice (similar to professional degrees for medicine and law).<ref name=\"norcrosspsyd\">Norcross, J. & Castle, P. (2002). [http://www.psichi.org/pubs/articles/article_171.asp Appreciating the PsyD: The Facts.] ''Eye on Psi Chi, 7(1),'' 22-26.</ref> A third training model called the Clinical Scientist Model emphasizes training in clinical psychology research. Outside of coursework, graduates of both programs generally are required to have had 2 to 3 years of supervised clinical experience, a certain amount of personal psychotherapy, and the completion of a dissertation (PhD programs usually require original quantitative empirical research, whereas the PsyD equivalent of dissertation research often consists of literature review and qualitative research, theoretical scholarship, program evaluation or development, critical literature analysis, or clinical application and analysis).\n\n===Continuing Education Requirements for Clinical Psychologists===\nMost states in the US require clinical psychologists to obtain a certain number of continuing education credits in order to renew their license.  This was established to ensure that psychologists stay current with information and practices in their fields. The license renewal cycle varies, but renewal is generally required every two years.<ref>{{cite book|title=Clinical Psychology: Integrating Science and Practice|year=2008|publisher=Hoboken: John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-471-41499-5|author=Freeman, Arthur, Stephanie H. Felgoise, and Denise D. Davis|accessdate=14 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe number of continuing education credits required for clinical psychologists varies between states.  In Nebraska, psychologists are required to obtain 24 hours of approved continuing education credits in the 24 months before their license renewal.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nebraska Department of Health & Human Services|url=http://dhhs.ne.gov/publichealth/Pages/crl_mhcs_psych_psychlicense.aspx#Education}}</ref>  In California, the requirement is for 36 hours of credits.  New York State does not have any continuing education requirements for license renewal at this time (2014).<ref>{{cite web|title=CE4Less|url=http://ce4less.com//WillMyStateAccept.aspx?st=New%20York&org=Psychologist|work=CEU Requirements for Psychologists in New York|accessdate=14 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nActivities that count towards continuing education credits generally include completing courses, publishing research papers, teaching classes, home study, and attending workshops.  Some states require that a certain number of the education credits be in ethics.  Most states allow psychologists to self-report their credits but randomly audit individual psychologists to ensure compliance.\n\n==Counseling psychologist or psychotherapist==\n{{Main|Psychotherapy|Counseling psychology}}\n\n[[Counseling]] generally involves helping people with what might be considered \"normal\" or \"moderate\" psychological problems, such as the feelings of anxiety or sadness resulting from major life changes or events.<ref name=\"brain\">Brain, Christine. (2002). ''Advanced psychology : applications, issues and perspectives.'' Cheltenham : Nelson Thornes. ISBN 0-17-490058-9></ref><ref name=\"compass\">Compass, B. & Gotlib, I. (2002). ''Introduction to Clinical Psychology.'' New York, NY : McGraw Hill. ISBN 0-07-012491-4</ref> As such, counseling psychologists often help people adjust to or cope with their environment or major events, although many also work with more serious problems as well.\n\nOne may practice as a counseling psychologist with a PhD or EdD, and as a counseling psychotherapist with a [[master's degree]]. Compared with clinical psychology, there are fewer counseling psychology graduate programs (which are commonly housed in departments of education), counselors tend to conduct more vocational assessment and less projective or objective assessment, and they are more likely to work in public service or university clinics (rather than hospitals or private practice).<ref>Norcross, John. (2000). [http://www.psichi.org/pubs/articles/article_73.asp Clinical versus counseling psychology: What's the diff?] ''Eye on Psi Chi, 5(1),'' 20-22.</ref> Despite these differences, there is considerable overlap between the two fields and distinctions between them continue to fade.\n\n==Behavior analyst==\n{{Main|Professional practice of behavior analysis}}\n\nBehavior analysts are licensed in five states to provide services for clients with [[substance abuse]], [[developmental disabilities]], and [[mental illness]]. This profession draws on the evidence base of [[applied behavior analysis]], [[behavior therapy]], and the philosophy of [[behaviorism]]. Behavior analysts have at least a master's degree in [[behavior analysis]] or in a mental health related discipline as well as at least five core courses in applied behavior analysis. Many behavior analysts have a doctorate. Most programs have a formalized internship program and several programs are offered online. Most practitioners have passed the examination offered by the behavior analysis certification board<ref>http://www.bacb.com</ref> or the examination in clinical behavior therapy by the World Association for Behavior Analysis.<ref>http://www.baojournal.com/WCBA/WCBA.html</ref> The model licensing act for behavior analysts can be found at the [[Association for Behavior Analysis International]]'s website.\n\n==Certified Mental Health Professional==\nThe Certified Mental Health Professional (CMHP) certification is designed to measure an individual\u2019s competency in performing the following job tasks. The job tasks are not presented in any particular order of importance.\n\n#Maintain confidentiality of records relating to clients\u2019 treatment.\n#Encourage clients to express their feelings, discuss what is happening in their lives, and help them to develop insight into themselves and their relationships.\n#Guide clients in the development of skills and strategies for dealing with their problems.\n#Prepare and maintain all required treatment records and reports.\n#Counsel clients and patients, individually and in group sessions, to assist in overcoming dependencies, adjusting to life, and making changes.\n#Collect information about clients through interviews, observations, and tests.\n#Act as the client\u2019s advocate in order to coordinate required services or to resolve emergency problems in crisis situations.\n#Develop and implement treatment plans based on clinical experience and knowledge.\n#Collaborate with other staff members to perform clinical assessments and develop treatment plans.\n#Evaluate client\u2019s physical or mental condition based on review of client information.\n\n==School psychologist==\n{{Main|School psychology}}\nSchool psychologists' primary concern is with the academic, social, and emotional well-being of children within a scholastic environment. Unlike clinical psychologists, they receive much more training in education, child development and behavior, and the psychology of learning, often graduating with a post-master's [[Educational specialist|educational specialist degree]] (EdS), EdD or [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (PhD) degree. Besides offering individual and group therapy with children and their families, school psychologists also evaluate school programs, provide cognitive assessment, help design prevention programs (e.g. reducing drops outs), and work with teachers and administrators to help maximize teaching efficacy, both in the classroom and systemically.<ref>Silva, Arlene. (2003). ''[http://www.nasponline.org/about_sp/whatis.aspx Who Are School Psychologists?]''. National Association of School Psychologists.</ref>\n\n==Social worker==\n{{Main|Social work}}\nSocial workers in the area of mental health may assess, treat, develop treatment plans, provide case management and/or rights advocacy to individuals with mental health problems.  They can work independently or within clinics/service agencies, usually in collaboration with other health care professionals.\n\nIn the US, they are often referred to as clinical social workers; each state specifies the responsibilities and limitations of this profession.  State licensing boards and national certification boards require clinical social workers to have a master's or doctoral degree (MSW or DSW/PhD) from a university. The doctorate in social work requires submission of a major original contribution to the field in order to be awarded the degree.\n\nIn the UK there is a now a standardized three-year undergraduate social work degree, or two-year postgraduate master's for those who already have an undergraduate social sciences degree and relevant work experience. These courses include mandatory supervised work experience in social work, which may include mental health services. Successful completion allows an individual to register and work as a qualified social worker. There are various additional optional courses for gaining qualifications specific to mental health, for example training in psychotherapy or, in England and Wales, for the role of [[Approved Mental Health Professional]] (two years' training for a legal role in the assessment and detention of eligible mentally disordered people under the [[Mental Health Act 1983|Mental Health Act (1983)]] as amended in 2007).\n\nSocial workers in England and Wales are now able to become Approved Clinicians under the [[Mental Health Act 2007]] following a period of further training (likely at postgraduate or doctoral level).  Historically, this role was reserved for [[psychiatrist]] medical doctors, but has now extended to registered [[mental health professionals]], such as [[social workers]], [[psychologists]] and mental health nurses.\n\nIn general, it is the social model rather than, or in addition to, the dominant medical model, that is the underlying rationale for mental health social work. This may include a focus on social causation, labeling, critical theory and social constructivism. Many argue social workers need to work with medical and health colleagues to provide an effective service but they also need to be at the forefront of processes that include and empower services users.<ref>Golightley, M. (2004) ''Social work and Mental Health'' Learning Matters, UK</ref>\n\n===Educational Requirements for Social Workers===\nIn the United States, the minimum requirement for social workers is generally a bachelor\u2019s degree in social work, though a bachelor\u2019s degree in a related field such as sociology or psychology may qualify an applicant for certain jobs.  Higher-level jobs typically require a master\u2019s degree in social work. Master\u2019s programs in social work usually last two years and consist of at least 900 hours of supervised instruction in the field.<ref name=\"US Bureau of Labor Statistics\">{{cite web|title=US Bureau of Labor Statistics|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/community-and-social-service/social-workers.htm#tab-4|accessdate=14 April 2014}}</ref> Regulatory boards generally require that degrees be obtained from programs that are accredited by the Council of Social Work Education (CSWE) or another nationally recognized accrediting agency.<ref>{{cite web|title=Association of Social Work Boards|url=http://www.aswb.org/licensees/about-licensing-and-regulation/}}</ref>\n\nBefore social workers can practice, they are required to meet the licensing, certification, or registration requirements of the state.  The requirements vary depending on the state but usually involve a minimum number of supervised hours in the field and passing of an exam.<ref name=\"US Bureau of Labor Statistics\"/> All states except California also require pre-licensure from the Association of Social Work Boards (ASWB).\n\nThe ASWB offers four categories of social work licensure. The lowest level is a Bachelors, for which a bachelor\u2019s degree in social work is required. The next level up is a Masters and a master\u2019s degree in social work is required. The Advanced Generalist category of social worker requires a master\u2019s degree in social work and two years of supervised post-degree experience.  The highest ASWB category is a Clinical Social Worker which requires a master\u2019s degree in social work along with two years of post-master\u2019s direct experience in social work.\n\n===Continuing Education Requirements for Social Workers===\nMost states require social workers to acquire a minimum number of continuing education credits per license, certification, or registration renewal period.  The purpose of these requirements is to ensure that social workers stay up-to-date with information and practices in their professions.  In most states, the renewal process occurs every two or three years.  The number of continuing education credits that is required varies between states but is generally 20 to 45 hours<ref>{{cite web|title=CE4Less|url=http://ce4less.com/profession/|work=Continuing Education Requirements for Mental Health Professionals|accessdate=14 April 2014}}</ref> during the two- or three-year period prior to renewal.\n\nCourses and programs that are approved as continuing education for social workers generally must be relevant to the profession and contribute to the advancement of professional competence.  They often include continuing education courses, seminars, training programs, community service, research, publishing articles, or serving on a panel.<ref>{{cite web|title=Washington State Dept. of Health|url=http://www.doh.wa.gov/LicensesPermitsandCertificates/ProfessionsNewReneworUpdate/SocialWorker/ContinuingEducationInformation.aspx#2|work=WAC 246-809-610|accessdate=14 April 2014}}</ref>  Many states require that a minimum amount of the credits be on topics such as ethics, HIV/AIDs, or domestic violence.\n\n==Psychiatric and mental health nurse==\n{{Main|Psychiatric and mental health nurse practitioner}}\n{{See also|Psychiatric and mental health nursing}}\n\nPsychiatric Nurses or Mental Health Nurse Practitioners work with people with a large variety of mental health problems, often at the time of highest distress, and usually within hospital settings.  These professionals work in primary care facilities, outpatient mental health clinics, as well as in hospitals and community health centers. MHNPs evaluate and provide care for patients who have anything from psychiatric disorders, medical mental conditions, to substance abuse problems.  They are licensed to provide emergency psychiatric services, assess the psychosocial and physical state of their patients, create treatment plans, and continually manage their care.  They may also serve as consultants or as educators for families and staff; however, the MHNP has a greater focus on psychiatric diagnosis, including the differential diagnosis of medical disorders with psychiatric symptoms and on medication treatment for psychiatric disorders.\n\n=== Educational requirements for psychiatric and mental health nurses ===\nPsychiatric and mental health nurses receive specialist education to work in this area. In some countries it is required that a full course of general [[nurse]] training be completed prior to specializing as a psychiatric nurse.  In other countries, such as the [[United Kingdom|U.K.]], an individual completes a specific nurse training course that determines their area of work.  As with other areas of nursing, it is becoming usual for psychiatric nurses to be educated to degree level and beyond.\n\nIn order to become a nurse practitioner in the U.S., at least six years of college education must be obtained.  After earning the bachelor's degree (usually in nursing, although there are master's entry level nursing graduate programs intended for individuals with a bachelor's degree outside of nursing) the test for licensure as a registered nurse (the NCLEX-RN) must be passed.  Next, the candidate must complete a state-approved master's degree advanced nursing education program which includes at least 600 clinical hours.  Several schools are now also offering further education and awarding a DNP ([[Doctor of Nursing Practice]]).\n\nIndividuals who choose a master's entry level pathway will spend an extra year at the start of the program taking classes necessary to pass the NCLEX-RN.  Some schools will issue a BSN, others will issue a certificate.  The student then continues with the normal MSN program.<ref>[http://nurseweb.ucsf.edu/www/spec-psy.htm MS Specialty: Advanced Practice Psychiatric Nursing - UCSF School of Nursing - - nurseweb.ucsf.edu<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.acnpweb.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3479.

The common terms used to describe this central division in psychology are \"scientists\" or \"scholars\" (those who conduct research) and \"practitioners\" or \"professionals\" (those who apply psychological knowledge). The training models endorsed by the APA require that applied psychologists be trained as both researchers and practitioners,<ref>See: [[Scientist\u2013practitioner model]] and [[Practitioner-scholar model]]</ref> and that they possess advanced degrees.\n\nMost typically, people encounter psychologists and think of the discipline as involving the work of [[Clinical psychology|clinical psychologists]] or counseling psychologists.

Under the national law, registration of psychologists is administered by the Psychology Board of Australia (PsyBA).<ref>[http://www.psychologyboard.gov.au/ Psychology Board of Australia]. Psychologyboard.gov.au. Retrieved on 2011-11-22.</ref> Before July 2010, professional registration of psychologists was governed by various State and Territory Psychology Registration Board.<ref>[http://www.psychreg.health.nsw.gov.au/ NSW Psychologist's Registration Board]</ref> The [[Australian Psychology Accreditation Council]] (APAC) oversees education standards for the profession of psychology.\n\nThe minimum requirements for general registration in psychology and to use the title 'psychologist' is an APAC approved four year degree sequence in psychology followed by either: (1) a two year masters program or (2) two years supervised by a registered psychologist.[http://www.apac.psychology.org.au/]. Endorsement within a specific area of practice (e.g. [[Counseling psychology|counselling]], [[Clinical psychology|clinical]], [[Clinical neuropsychology|neuropsychological]], [[Industrial and organizational psychology|organizational]], [[Forensic psychology|forensic]], or [[Educational psychology|educational]]) requires additional qualification.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologyboard.gov.au/Endorsement.aspx |title=Psychology Board of Australia - Endorsement |publisher=Psychologyboard.gov.au |date=2010-07-01 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}</ref> These notations are not 'specialist' titles (Western Australian psychologists may use 'specialist' in their titles during a three year transitional period).<ref>[http://www.psychologyboard.gov.au/documents/default.aspx?record=WD10%2f3764&dbid=AP&chksum=zRjgqyUmQ4luixdLF8nTCA%3d%3d Transition provisions for Western Australia psychologists Fact Sheet]</ref>\n\nMembership with [[Australian Psychological Society]] (APS) differs from registration as a psychologist. The standard route to full membership (MAPS) of the APS technically requires a masters or doctoral degree in psychology in an accredited course. An alternate route is available for academics and practitioners who have gained appropriate experience and made substantial contribution to the field of psychology. Association membership requires four years of APAC accredited undergraduate study.\n\nRestrictions apply to all who want to use the title 'psychologist' in any form in all states and territories of Australia. However, the terms 'psychotherapist', 'social worker', and 'counselor' are currently self-regulated with several organizations campaigning for government regulation.<ref>e.g. [[Australian Counseling Association]] and [[Psychotherapy and Counseling Federation of Australia]]</ref>\n\n===Belgium===\nIn Belgium, the title \"psychologist\" is protected by law since 1993. It can only be used by people who are included as such on the list of a national government commission. The minimum requirement is a completed five years university training in psychology (Master's degree or equivalent). The title of \"psychotherapist\" is not legally protected (yet).\n\n===Finland===\nIn [[Finland]], the title \"psychologist\" is protected by law. Restriction is governed by [[National Supervisory Authority for Welfare and Health (Finland)]]. It takes 330 ECTS-credits (about six years) to accomplish the studies.\n\n===Germany===\nIn [[Germany]], the use of the title 'Diplom-Psychologe' is restricted by law, and a practitioner is legally required to hold the corresponding academic title, which is comparable to a higher MSc degree and requires up to five years of training.  With the current reforms, this degree will be replaced by a lower master's degree and a new [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D. in psychology]].\nThe academic degree of Diplom-Psychologe does not include a psychotherapeutical qualification, which requires three to five years of additional training.  The psychotherapeutical  training combines in-depth theoretical knowledge with supervised patient care and self-reflection units. After having completed the training requirements, psychologists take a state-run exam, which, upon successful completion, confers the official title of 'psychological psychotherapist' (psychologischer Psychotherapeut). {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n===Greece===\nIn Greece, the title \"psychologist\" has been protected by law since 1979. It can only be used by people who hold a relevant licence to practice as a psychologist. The minimum requirement is the completion of university training in psychology at a Greek university, or at a university recognized by the Greek authorities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seps.gr/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=204:announcement&catid=69:2011&Itemid=298 |title=\u0391\u03bd\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03af\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u0394\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd \u03a3\u03c5\u03bc\u03b2\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03a3\u03c5\u03bb\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5 \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03ae\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd \u03a8\u03c5\u03c7\u03bf\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd |publisher=Seps.gr |date=2011-04-19 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}</ref>\n\n===The Netherlands===\nIn the Netherlands, the title of \"psychologist\" is not restricted by law. The Dutch professional association of psychologists (NIP), using trademark law, therefore posited its own title \"Psychologist NIP\" (Psycholoog NIP), which is granted exclusively to holders of a Masters degree in psychology, after a year of postgraduate experience.\nThe titles \"psychotherapist\" (psychotherapeut) and \"healthcare psychologist\" (gz-psycholoog / gezondheidszorgpsycholoog) are restricted through the Individual Healthcare Professions Act (wet BIG) to those who have followed further postgraduate (PsyD/DPsych or Licentiate level) training. The use of the titles \"clinical psychologist\" (klinisch psycholoog) and clinical neuropsychologist (klinisch neuropsycholoog) is reserved for those who have followed specialist post-licentiate training.\n\n===New Zealand===\nIn New Zealand, the use of the title \"psychologist\" is restricted by law. Prior to 2004, only the title \"Registered Psychologist\" was restricted (to people qualified and registered as such). However with the proclamation of the Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003, the use of the title \"Psychologist\" was limited to practitioners registered with the New Zealand Psychologists Board. (The titles \"Clinical Psychologist\", \"Counselling Psychologist\", \"Educational Psychologist\", \"Intern Psychologist\", and \"Trainee Psychologist\" are similarly protected.) This is to protect the public by providing assurance that the title user is registered and therefore qualified, competent, and can be held accountable for their practice. The legislation does not currently include an exemption clause for any class of practitioner (e.g., academics, or government employees).\n\n===South Africa===\nIn [[South Africa]],<ref>Sourced from the Departments of Psychology: [http://web.uct.ac.za/depts/psychology/ University of Cape Town], [http://www.wits.ac.za/umthombo/psychology/7311/home.html University of the Witwatersrand], [http://www.unisa.ac.za/Default.asp?Cmd=ViewContent&ContentID=14025 University of South Africa]</ref> psychologists are qualified in one of Clinical-, Counselling-, Educational-, Organisational- or Research Psychology.  To attain the qualification, one must complete a recognised [[Masters degree]] in Psychology and an appropriate [[practicum]] at a recognised training institution, and also sit an examination set by the Professional Board for Psychology.<ref>[http://www.hpcsa.co.za/board_psychology.php Professional Board for Psychology].

Retrieved on 2011-11-22.</ref> is required, and includes a [[Continuing Professional Development]] component. The practicum usually involves a full year [[internship]], and in some specializations the HPCSA requires completion of an additional year of [[community service]]. The Master's comprises [[seminar]]- and [[coursework]]-based theoretical and practical [[training]], and a [[dissertation]] of limited scope, and is (in most cases) two years in duration.  Prior to enrolling for the Master\u2019s, the student will have studied psychology for three years as an undergraduate ([[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] or [[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc.]], and, for Organisational Psychology, also [[Bachelor of Commerce|B.Com.]]), followed by an additional [[postgraduate]] [[Bachelor's degree#South Africa|honours degree]] in psychology; see [[List of universities in South Africa]]. Qualification thus requires at least five years of study, and at least one of internship.\n\n===Sweden===\nIn Sweden the title \"psychologist\" is restricted in law. It can only be used after receiving a license from the government. The basic requirements are a completed five years specialised course in psychology (equivalent of a Master's degree) and 12 months of practice under supervision. All other uses are banned, though often challenged.\n\"Psychotherapist\" follows similar rules but the basic educational demands are another 1.5 years (spread out over three years) at a specialised course in psychotherapy (that do vary a lot concerning theoretical footing), in addition to an academical level degree within a field concerning the treatment of people (psychologist, social worker, [[psychiatrist]] a.s.o.). Others than psychologist usually have to complete their education with basic courses in psychotherapy to meet the demands for the applied psychotherapy classes.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nIn the UK the following titles are restricted by law: \"registered psychologist\" and \"practitioner psychologist\"; in addition the following specialist titles are restricted by law: \"clinical psychologist\", \"counselling psychologist\", \"educational psychologist\", \"forensic psychologist\", \"health psychologist\", \"occupational psychologist\" and \"sport and exercise psychologist\".<ref>[http://www.hpc-uk.org/apply/psychologists/ HPC \u2013 Health Professions Council \u2013 Becoming registered as a practitioner psychologist].

In the UK the use of the title \"chartered psychologist\" is also protected by statutory regulation.  The title \"chartered psychologist\" simply means that the psychologist is a chartered member of the [[British Psychological Society]] but it does not necessarily signify the psychologist is registered with the HPC-UK. It is an offense for someone who is not in the appropriate section of the HPC-UK Register to provide clinical psychology services, counselling psychology services, educational psychology services, forensic psychology services, health psychology services, occupational psychology services or sport and exercise psychology services.<ref>[http://www.hpc-uk.org/aboutregistration/protectedtitles/ HPC \u2013 Health Professions Council \u2013 Protected titles].

Associate membership requires at least two years of postgraduate studies in psychology or approved related discipline. The minimal requirement for full membership can be waived in certain circumstances where there is evidence that significant contribution or performance in the field of psychology has been made.<ref>[http://www.apa.org/about/division/officers/handbook/membership.aspx APA Membership information].

To practice clinically, they must hold a clinical license to practice as a psychologist.<ref>\"Currently, '''all''' (State) jurisdictions have laws that limit the use of the term psychologist to those who are licensed or who are specifically exempt, as in an exempt setting.\" (Reference: [[American Psychological Association]] ('''APA''') [http://www.siop.org/tip/jan09/17silzer.aspx   Division 14,  Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology ('''SIOP''')])</ref> The exception to this is the profession of a school psychologist who can be certified by boards of education to practice and use the title \"psychologist\" with an Education Specialist (Ed.S) degree.  The most commonly recognized psychology professionals are clinical and counseling psychologists, those who provide [[psychotherapy]] and/or administer and interpret psychological tests. There are state-by-state differences in requirements for academics in psychology and government employees.\n\nPsychologists in the United States have campaigned for legislation changes to enable specially trained psychologists to [[Prescriptive authority for psychologists movement|prescribe psychiatric medicine]]. New legislation in [[Louisiana]] and [[New Mexico]] has granted those who take an additional masters program in [[psychopharmacology]] permission to prescribe medications for mental and emotional disorders in co-ordination with the patient's physician. Louisiana was the second state to provide such legislation.<ref name=\"louisianapsychologist.org\">[http://www.louisianapsychologist.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&subarticlenbr=6 Louisiana Psychological Association]. Louisianapsychologist.org. Retrieved on 2011-11-22.</ref> This legislation has not come without considerable controversy. As of 2009, Louisiana is the only of the United States where the licensing and regulation of the practice of psychology by medical psychologists who prescribe medications is regulated by a medical board (i.e., the Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners) rather than a board of psychologists.<ref>http://nationalpsychologist.com/2010/03/louisiana-rxp-psychologist-defends-regulatory-change/101127.html</ref>  While other states have pursued prescriptive privileges, they have yet to be successful.

Perhaps the most significant difference is that psychiatrists are licensed [[physicians]]. As such, psychiatrists often use the [[medical model]] to assess mental health problems and rely on [[psychoactive drug|psychotropic medications]] as the chief method of addressing mental health problems<ref>{{cite journal|author=Graybar, S. and Leonard, L. |year=2005|journal=American Journal of Psychotherapy|volume=59|issue=1|pages= 1\u201319}}</ref>\u2014although many also employ psychotherapy as well. Clinical psychologists receive extensive training in psychological test administration, scoring, interpretation and reporting. These tests help to inform diagnostic decisions and treatment planning.  For example, in a medical center, a patient with a complicated clinical presentation who is being seen by a psychiatrist might be referred to a clinical psychologist for psychological testing to aid in diagnosis and treatment.  In addition, psychologists (particularly those from PhD programs) spend several years in graduate school being trained to conduct behavioral research, including research design and advanced statistical analysis.  While this training is available for physicians via dual MD/PhD programs, it is not typically included in medical education.\n\nPsychologists generally do not prescribe medication, although there is a growing movement for clinical psychologists to have limited prescribing privileges. Clinical and other psychologists are experts at psychotherapy (typically clinical psychologists are trained in a number of psychological therapies, including, behavioural, cognitive, humanistic, existential, psychodynamic, and systemic approaches), and [[psychological testing]] (e.g. including [[neuropsychological test]]ing). In two US states, specifically New Mexico and Louisiana, some psychologists with post-doctoral pharmacology training have been granted [[RxP|prescriptive authority]] for certain mental health disorders upon agreement with the patient's physician.<ref>{{cite web | title = Louisiana grants psychologists prescriptive authority | url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/louisianarx.html | date = 5 May 2004 | accessdate = 16 July 2009}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of psychologists]]\n* [[Psychology]]\n* [[Psychiatry]]\n* [[Psychiatrist]]\n* [[Mental health professional]]\n* [[List of psychological topics]]\n* [[List of psychologists on postage stamps]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=35em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Spoken Wikipedia|Psychologist.ogg|2006-12-17}}\n* [http://www.efpa.eu European Federation of Psychologists' Associations]\n* [http://www.nationalpsychologist.com/ The National Psychologist], an independent bi-monthly newspaper for behavioral healthcare practitioners\n* [http://dictionary-psychology.com Psychology terms]\n* [http://www.apa.org/index.aspx American Psychological Association]\n* [http://www.hkadcp.com.hk Hong Kong Association of Doctors in Clinical Psychology]\n\n{{Psychology}}\n\n[[Category:Psychologists]]\n[[Category:Mental health professionals]]\n[[Category:Psychology]]\n[[Category:Wikipedia articles needing clarification]]\n\n[[ko:\uc2ec\ub9ac\ud559]]", "Certified Sex Therapist": "'''Certified Sex Therapists''' ('''CST''') have graduate degrees and can demonstrate their competence in sex therapy by becoming credentialed by the [[American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors and Therapists]] (AASECT).<ref name=Mayo>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/sex-therapy/MY01349 Mayo Clinic]</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe AASECT certification process was started in the 1970s as a form of quality control\u2014to ensure that clients and patients could receive competent treatment from practitioners who were calling themselves [[sex therapists]].

Every certified sex therapist must agree to abide by the AASECT [[code of ethics]], which stresses competence and integrity along with moral, ethical, and legal responsibility to safeguard the well-being of clients.  Further, sex therapist certification requires up to 50 hours of direct supervision by a certified sex therapy supervisor \u2014 half of these hours can take place in small, pre-approved groups.  For the vast majority of professionals in health care and human services, certification is a prerequisite to practice. AASECT credentials sexual health professionals on the basis of rigorous standards for academic preparation, supervised training and consultation, field-related experience and applied skills.  Field experience and practical application of skills and competencies carried out under trained and approved supervision or consultation are crucial aspects of certification.
