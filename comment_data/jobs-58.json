Pay varies from gig to gig...typically a day rate. For my position and experience $250-350/day is average (10-12 hour day with 1 hour lunch and two 15 minute breaks).\n\n Depending on gig, overtime will kick in between hours 8 and 10 with increased OT pay after hours 12, 15, 18. If working a Sunday, I usually get automatic overtime (1.5) from the start. If a gig goes past midnight, overtime kicks in regardless of day (Monday), or hour you're on (3 vs. 17). Also, if there is a short turnaround (&gt;5 hours), the first few hours of work started are in OT.\n\nWhen I first started (about 7 yrs ago), I took free gigs to gain experience and network (worked retail jobs to pay bills, and parents helped). My only compensation would be lunch (usually pizza), and a \"thank you.\" Now, I only work paid gigs. Once in a blue moon, i'll do a friend a favor and work pro bono for a day. Only put in about 6 hours though, and don't use any of my equipment outside of hand tools. Have made as much as $800/day, but it was for 18 hours. Extra pay if own equipment is being used (rental fee), or certifications (electrician, rigger, machine operator). Salary goal for 2014 is $55K. \n\nOftentimes I get to wear whatever I want, unless I'm the actual on site tech for show then a black polo and black slacks (show blacks) are required. Due to the amount of wear and tear I put my clothes through, this has required me to designate part of my wardrobe as \"work clothes\". It also means I have to buy certain clothing items for work. In the past I have bought steel toed boots (which are surprisingly comfy after 15 hours), cargo pants and shorts (helps to carry around multiple items), socks for cold weather, long johns, galloshes, and three types of coats depending on weather...all for work (tax write off). It's come to the point, where I'm buying clothes for work more often than leisure. \n\n\nNecessary to keep up with ever changing technological landscape (New type of light) while not forgetting old practices (how to tie certain knots). I've learned more outside of school, than in it. I didn't know how to operate a generator, scissorlift, forklift until 2 yrs after I graduated from college in 2008. At least half the gigs I work, a scissorlift lift is needed.\n\nChanges the way you watch a movie, tv show, or attend a concert. You start watching things from a technicians POV instead of as a fan. I don't try either, it just happens. \n\nSmall community, so I don't try not to burn bridges, or mess up because everyone knows another and word spreads.\n\nMember of two unions (IATSE 484 and 127 - Dallas, TX chapter), so I have health insurance and a retirement savings plan. Paying dues isn't bad. I work enough to were I can keep up with them, and pay my regular bills. Also, if working a union gig, start time for the next day HAS to be at least 12 hours away from end of previous night. Some tv shows I've worked in the past will have a 8am call time on Monday, but will be 3pm by Friday. \n\nMost times, I only have to worry about my department (lighting) when setting up, operating, or striking. Once my job is complete, I'm free to leave. \n\nCost of living in Dallas is great compared to other large cities (L.A., New York, Austin), so Im able to lead a decent life, and afford cool shit. Just bought a new truck, renting a suburban house (2 bedroom w/backyard...for my dog), and have all kinds of cool stuff (foosball table, tablet, laptop, big screen tv, etc). \n\nNo kids, not married, free travel -travel pay and per diem included. I have been to 17 states and two countries (Canada and Dominican Republic) because of my job. If I'm working an out of town gig that last a few days to a week and it's within driving distance (&gt;9 hours) of home, i'll take my dog with me. Most hotels allow pets if you pay a fee (out of pocket expense). Stayed in some hotel rooms where the cost for one night is about 20% of what I pay in rent. \n\n27 yrs old.  Give my \"job\" an 8/10. Can't give it a ten because I tend to work weekends, long hours (10-15/day sometimes with only a 30 minute lunch), which can be at obscure times. I've started work as early as 4am, and will be finished by 9am. Also, started work at 9pm and watched the sun rise on the way home. My job is very labor intensive, too. Never calculated it, I wouldn't doubt if I burn around 400 calories/hour during the summer months.\n\nPaying taxes are no bueno, tambi\u00e9n. Each year I come up with new write off (thank God for smartphones). \n\nSucks to work when you're friends aren't (holidays, weekends). But sleeping in til 11:30 am on a Tuesday is nice.\n \nI hate clients. Just because you're paying for my services doesn't mean you know how to do my job. \n\nLighting is subjective. What looks nice to one person, can look like shit to another. \n\nEquipment isn't cheap, and maintaining it is a necessary evil. I don't get paid to fix or build my own lights. Light instruments with accessories can cost up to $10,000.  Though I haven't paid that much personally. Craigslist, amazon, eBay, and local production shops are a god send. One can typically find used equipment, or a knockoff brand that works just as well for up to 50% lesser than the \"Jordan\" brand. \n\nCamera technology is becoming so advanced in capturing light, that outside of ambient (the sun, overhead lights), not much lighting is needed. This usually means less techs on set (2-5). And since I'm still fairly new, I'm odd man out. Though, I don't think this is a position that will die out. \n\nAt the end of the day, I'm replaceable. A client could easily hire someone less experienced, pay a lower rate, and still get the job done. So, it helps having other skills you can bring to the table (camera op, audio engineer). \n\nAlso, I hate that my job is so dependent on my body. Much as I love my job, I don't want to be 60 with a busted back. Also, if I get hurt that could set me back for a few months. \n\n\"It's not what you know, but who you know,\" rings so true in my industry. There have been plenty of times I've landed a gig because someone I know got me the job. In return, I've contributed to my friends bank accounts by recommending them for a gig if I'm not available, or trying to get them on with me. BUT, there have been times I didn't get a gig because the gaffer (head lighting tech) wants to go with guys he's worked with for years (usually longer than I've been alive). Close knit circles are common in my industry. Rarely do they allow someone new in. If it does happen, its usually the child of a crew member.\n\nLots of rules and regulations that must be followed for safety reasons.Depending on gig, they are (union) or arent (my buddy's short film). \n\n Working in film there are attractive women EVERYWHERE (the actresses are just the tip of the iceberg). If I have to be somewhere for 12 hours, in the sun, busting my ass it helps to have a pretty lady to talk to from time to time. Most people I work with are cool. It's nice working with someone who has the same amount passion as I do about something. Even actors can be fun. More often than not, they're the nicest person on set. Though they're world famous, they don't forget who they are, where they came from, and don't look down on the crew, If they know they're going to be on set all day, or on a gig a few months some actors will make the effort to get to know you. Instead of going back to their trailer between their scenes, they'll stick around  and hang out with the crew. Lunch is different. If It's close enough, they'll go back to the trailer for lunch (to nap). It's good to know that someone who is portrayed so wonderfully by the media, is a person just like you. \n \nFree stuff is nice too. Once got a pair of Beats by Dre headphones as a Christmas gift for one tv show I worked on. Also worked the install for a Justin Timberlake concert recently..On top of being paid, I got free tickets (mid level - not nosebleed, but not front row), and meet and greet passes. When the Super Bowl was in Dallas, I was part of the crew that set up the stage for halftime. Got to be on the field for the show, and saw the first half of the game from the tunnels. \n\nI've gone weeks without buying groceries because of free food on set. Once again, depending on the gig, the client (for live events) or production studio (for tv) will provide a lunch, but I have had all three meals provided. And you tend to get pick from an assortment. There are times I've had some great food (lobster tails), and just a shitty turkey sandwich. Most feature films, and network tv shows will have people who's sole job is to provide snacks for the crew. Usually, the snacks provided are whatever the heart desires. On show I worked on had a trailer full of snacks. It was literally like walking into a 7-Eleven. \nFrom time to time, I'll score free booze. I've walked away with entire 12 packs of various beers after some shows. I've also been given bottles of wine or liquor as presents for \"jobs well done.\"\n\n Also, I have my mom's blessing, and she has never tried to change my mind on a different career. \n"}
