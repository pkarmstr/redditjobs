You'd be surprised how little feedback app designers get from users, so if you file it, it's very likely to get someone's attention.\n\nSecond, if you file feedback and you don't follow one of the templates above, it will be someone's job to take your feedback and try to reform it so it does follow one of those templates, depending on whether it's a bug or feature request.

    "cckn9al": "**I work at a movie theater.**\n\n1.) Popcorn, when it comes out of the kettle, begins to cool down *immediately* because it's very porous. It also doesn't help that the interior of most movie theaters are witch-titty cold. If your popcorn isn't piping hot, it isn't because it was popped an hour ago, two hours ago, or last night. It also doesn't mean that we shipped it in pre-popped. An entire batch can go from hot to luke-warm in under thirty minutes, even with the warmer turned on. Just ask us to pop you a new batch instead of throwing around accusations and conspiracy theories.\n\n2.) The interiors of most movie theaters are going to be witch-titty cold. That's not on accident. If we didn't have a massive amount of air conditioning circulating through the building at all times, we'd essentially have a bunch of closed boxes filled with heavily breathing people and shitty microwaved chicken tenders. Things would get hot n' stuffy pretty fast--and the problem with hot is that there's nothing to do for hot. If somebody's hot in the theater, they can't start taking off their clothes to cool down. If you're cold, you *can* put on a sweater. So instead of telling me that I need to turn down the air conditioning, *put on a fucking sweater*. \n\n3.) The chicken tenders are going to be both shitty and microwaved. Do you see the concession stand? Unless you're in a really high-end theater with a dedicated kitchen, that's all the space and equipment we have. If you don't see an oven or a grill, expect frozen, reheated food, and don't be astounded that you've just paid ten dollars for four rubbery, bland chicken tenders. \n\n4.) Everything in a movie theater costs ten dollars, and unless if you haven't been to a movie in the last thirteen years, that shouldn't shock you. \"WHAAAT!? Four fifty for a box of milk duds!? I coulda bought these at Walgreens for a dollar twenty five and snuck em' in!\" I know. I know that. Shut your whore mouth. \n\n5.) You *can* sneak food into a movie theater, and most of the employees there who aren't managers and bag checkers will not give a solitary shit. And even if there is a bag checker, I guarantee there's no pocket checker. It doesn't even require you to be crafty. If you're going to hold up a line by bitching and moaning about the concession prices, we'd rather you go the extra mile and just sneak it in.\n\n6.) After your movie's done and you get up from your seat, look down around your feet and ask yourself, \"Did I just leave a huge fucking slovenly mess all over the place?\" If the answer's yes, then pick it up and direct yourself to one of the literally dozens of trashcans we place between you and the exit. \n\nAnd finally 7.) I know you bought your ticket online, but that doesn't mean you don't have to stand in line at the box office. When you order online, what you're actually getting is a voucher for a ticket that you then have to redeem with a member of the staff. The voucher guarantees that you'll have a seat in a potentially otherwise sold out screening, and the fact that it's not a ticket lets us know that people aren't printing counterfeit tickets at home. Yes, I know that seems both pointless and retarded, but I'm the popcorn guy and *not* the CEO of Fandango.com. Complain to them, or just don't use the service (which is often times more expensive than showing up early and buying a ticket in-house, making it doubly stupid). \n\nADDENDUM: \n\n8.) If you go to the last screening of the night, *leave when the credits stop rolling*.  Don't stand in a circle with all of your friends in the lobby and have an hour-long discussion about the movie you just saw, because the people who work there can't go home until you do. Also, because most theaters are owned by corporate bodies who are obsessed with customer service and keeping people around to potentially spend more money, you're often told that you can't outright ask people to fuck off once the building's closed. You just have to kind of sit there and stare at them until they get the hint. ",

Without getting too technical, they really do cause interference. Now, I couldn't care less about anything without an antenna or anything not actually designed to transmitt any RF waves. But I have personally witnessed numerous times problems from cell phones. Most common has to be the GSM phone pinging we hear very loudly at times on our headsets, which overpowers ATC transmissions. Worst case scenario I had an on 3 separate occasions a complete instrument (AHRS, for those in the know) failure when I forgot to turn off my own cell phone and received either phone call or text (this was at low altitude, yes you can receive and make calls up to 10000ft over the ground in populated areas on a good day, I tested this on a light GA plane, chill out).

(Yes, this happens every day.)\n\n* Make sure you actually have the money to buy the things you put on my register belt. I don't have the time to stop and price check every single item and hold your hand to make sure you can stretch that $20 bill as far as it can go. Also, don't give me shit if your card is declined. That's not us. That's never, ever us. Maybe it's your bank, but usually, almost always, it's you.\n\n* Finally, if you really, really want to make my day easier, just don't come in my store.

    "cckp4np": "Waiter here. There's actually several things you can do to make our lives easier and thus make the visit more enjoyable for you and the other guests in the restaurant.\n\n**1.) Say you're ready to order ONLY if you mean it.** Being \"ready\" to order is not a request to begin looking at the menu and pondering your options. Every second of time is crucial to a server, as there are probably 5-10 other things we need to be doing at that very moment (this is not an exaggeration). The more you make us wait, the more you make the other tables wait. Please, only say you're ready to order if you truly mean it.\n\n**2.) Avoid splitting the check at all costs if you can help it.** This is a HUGE pain in the ass to servers. Splitting a check a couple ways is no big deal. This rule is more for the people who want it split 5 ways, 10 ways, etc. Splitting a check takes up an exorbitant amount of time, and will likely frustrate the hell out of your waiter in the process.\n\n**3.) Consolidate your needs.** If someone at your table asks for a side of ranch, and I ask \"Does anyone else need anything at the moment?\", now's your time to tell me or forever hold your peace. *Nothing* is more frustrating than running to get a side of ranch, bringing it to the table, and then having someone else go, \"Can I get one too?\". **You. Asshole.** Same goes for napkins, extra plates, etc, that I can grab on my way over to you. It's really not the size or the amount of what you need that's annoying, it's the extra trips back to the kitchen that frustrate us (again, it's because we have so many other things to be doing at once).\n\n**4.) I only have two hands.** Unless your waiter is a mutant, they can only carry so much at once. If you clearly see my hands are full, please give me a moment to run them to the dish tub. I cannot write down an order at this time, pour more wine out of your bottle, or do anything that would require me to hold something at this very moment.\n\n**5.) Don't ask for things you have no intention of using.** I will get you as many things as you need, but *please* do not ask for waters all around at a table that is very obviously going to be getting a beverage other than water (soda, tea, lemonade, etc). This is not only an extra trip I have to make, but will also cause unnecessary clutter on the table. When we bring your food out, there will be less space to set everything down.\n\n**6.) Please don't be picky about where you're seated while being seated.** Servers are assigned certain sections (clusters of tables) to wait on every night. If you make a request to sit in a booth at the host stand, this is no big deal. However (and this is key), if you are already being walked to your table, please do not make a request to sit somewhere else. This messes up the rotation that servers get seated, and by messing with this, you run the risk of having a server being double or triple sat. This essentially means a server is given 3 tables in a very short amount of time, which slows them down and service suffers as a result.\n\n**7.) Don't go crazy on the substitutions.** I completely understand you want your salad made with spinach instead of romaine. I get that you want blue cheese instead of ranch dressing. I get it. One or two substitutions is fine. Creating a dish that isn't on the menu because you are picky is not fine. Most computer terminals where we punch in orders have a very small character limit. It's sometimes impossible to write in the parameters of your order within this small space. A good rule of thumb is to not criss-cross dishes with other dishes.\n\n**8.) Place your credit card somewhere where it's visible to us.** Most restaurants give you a handy dandy little book to place your credit card in. Please insert the card in the designated spot up top so we can see you are ready to pay. It's very hard to gauge whether or not you're ready if you don't do this as we will just naturally assume there is nothing in the booklet.\n\n**9.) Please leave as soon as possible.** We don't want to rush you, but please do not sit around for an extended period of time chit chatting after you have finished. Chances are there are other guests waiting to be seated, and by sitting idly you are taking up rent in that server's section. Please keep in mind a 10-15 min conversation after you're done is no big deal. It's the people who stay for 30 mins and sometimes HOURS after that really annoy us. If we are sent home for the night, we cannot leave until our tables are gone. If a server is giving you that look that says \"kindly GTFO\", we really would like you to leave. :) It's nothing personal, but we have families and homes to go to after work, just like you do.",

Before i started working at one, I thought that 20% was high for a tip, but what I didn't realize was that waiters live off their tips, as most get minimum wage. Not only that, but they have to tip out the bussers, the bar, the food expos, and some places even the hosts, which dwindles their tips from 20% to less than 10%. And that's if they get tipped 20%, which most of the time is not the case. You may be asking yourself, \"why would they deserve so much?\" \nThink about it-- a server not only has to take your order, with any kind of modification requested, they have to input your order with said modifications, and ensure the kitchen is making everything to your liking.

    "cckqeoa": "I work in a store in the mall that sells same-day custom tee shirts and vinyl decals, along with body jewelry and cell phone cases. An odd combination but it makes money. Here are some things I need to tell you folks about each item:\n\nTee shirts: Please don't pay for your shirt and then walk out. I need to make sure the design I pulled up on the computer is the one you want, especially if you want something custom that we have to make on the spot. Even if it's three words, I still want you to be happy with the font/size it will be. And if you walk out before you pick a color for your design (heat press shirt vinyl is what we make the designs out of) then you will get the generic white or black and you will like it.\n\nAnd for the love of god, if you unfold a shirt to see how big it is, please don't try to refold it and put it back. Just hand it to me, I will refold it and I will appreciate it more than you trying to fold it again. You aren't bothering me to tell me you unfolded a shirt, you are actually making my job easier. Oh, and especially don't be that dickbag who looks at the shirt for a second, wads it up, and then *crams it back into the display*. **Do not be that guy.**\n\nBody jewelry: It would be awesome if you knew your gauge size before you came into the store so I don't have to do the guess work for you. We absolutely, never ever, do returns on body jewelry, so if you buy something and it isn't the right gauge, it's yours forever, and there's not a damn thing I can do about it.\n\nAnd know exactly what you want and what the different kind of piercings are. If you want tapers, don't browse the belly button rings and ask me if they'll fit your ear. If you want a labret, the barbels and industrials are not the area you should be browsing. And if you need a replacement ball for your horseshoe, you should know the gauge of that as well, because the ball size depends entirely on your gauge. If you don't know, bring it in. I have a gauge sizer and I would be more than happy to check for you. \n\nCell phone cases: Literally the worst thing you can do to me is when I ask what kind of phone you have, you respond with \"Samsung\" or \"Motorola\" and not the model. Or even worse, \"I don't know.\" The best customers are the kind of customers that walk up and say, \"Okay, I just went to Verizon and got this Razr Maxx HD and I just want to check out the cases you have for that.\" Those customers are the BEST. The next worst thing you can do is get mad at *me* for not knowing what phone you have. I can recognize a few popular phones pretty quickly, but if you have some obscure phone you got on sale at T-Mobile, please, at least try to figure out what phone you have. Telling me the make but not the model will not help either of us out and will waste your time as well as mine.\n\nAlso, please know that no two phone cases are the same. Just because that one is a nicer color than the one that actually fit your phone, I will guarantee that the Motorola case you like more will not fit your LG phone. Please don't attempt to snap it on to your phone to see how it looks, because you will break it, and yes, you will buy it.\n\nThis may seem like pretty obscure stuff but some of it is pretty universal. \n\ntl;dr, just know what you want and what you already have if you're shopping for something very specific.",

    "cckl3qi": "Former bar manager here.\n\nThe following tips will make it easier not just for bartenders, but for you as a customer and your fellow patrons:\n\n1. **Have your order ready by the time the bartender gets to you**. If you've just got there, no biggie. But if you've been in a line waiting for a drink and still not ready to order by the time the bartender gets to you, you're wasting the bartender's time as well as the other patrons.\n\n2. If you have to ask 'can I put that on card?' with a face that looks like you're about to push out a mammoth shit, chances are you know that what you're doing is a dick move. **Bring cash if you can**.\n\n3. **DO NOT CHAIN ORDER**. Nothing is more aggravating to bartenders and other patrons around you than when you have your first 3 drinks made completely before you decide to tack on other items. Have it all ready to go by the time the bartender asks you what you would like.\n\n4. **Do not whistle, clap, bang on the bar or yell to get the attention of a bartender**. If you're in a packed bar, chances are you're in the same boat with other people and the bartender is aiming to get to you as quickly as possible. The best thing to do is try to get eye contact with the bartender and throw a bit of a nod their way. Some may be stressed, I'm sure you are too when you do your job.\n\n5. **Be an empathetic human being**. If your drink has been made incorrectly, don't come charging to the bar yelling your ass off.  Someone made a mistake, they will fix it and we all move on.\n\n6. **Don't be a dick**. Sometimes people have bad days, even you. The only difference here is that someone doesn't come into your office and shouts at you to 'smile'. If the bartender is doing their job and for some reason isn't in a good mood, I can tell you from experience that telling them to smile is a surefire way to keep them in that terrible mood. Just because we are in the hospitality/service industry, it does not make us immune to bad or off days. Have some compassion.\n\n7. **Tip what you feel is right**. This is probably the most controversial point, especially from me because I come from a country where tipping is not mandatory as our minimum wage is actually quite high (~$20-25/h). Tip what you feel the service is worth. General rules are: Good service - 10%, Great Service - 15%, Excellent Service - 20%. I feel this would be an extremely different point written from an American perspective but I obviously cannot vouch for them.\n\n8. **Service not servitude**. If there's anything to take from all this, it is to be a courteous human being. We are not your slaves, we chose to do this for a living and the sooner you realise this, the less reprimands/kickouts you will receive for being a massive fuckwit.",

If you have to use it, please for the love of god tell us. There is little worse in this job than opening a tire to a blast of warm sticky chemical goo in the face. \n\n* no, we're not trying to rip you off. Your sensors died/your tire is unsafe/we cannot repair your flat. Its not that we dont want to, it's that your vehicle is now a danger to you and everyone on the road. Our salesman will go to awesome lengths to keep you safe, dont give them crap for it.\n\n* yes, that person who got here after you was done first. Their job took 5 minutes, yours takes 30.

Even if they did, your group number or anything else could have changed. \n\nI do not know specifically what your DR prescribed your antibiotic for. If you do not know what you went to the DR for, you maybe need to check back in with him.\n\nIf I tell you your prescription will take 30 minutes because you dropped off 4+ rx's and its 530pm on a Friday night, it will take AT LEAST that. Yes, I know you have shit to do. So do the other half-dozen people in line, in the lobby, and in both lanes of my drive-thru. If I have to call the DR because he forgot to put a quantity or directions or refill or strength or if it interacts with something else you're on, we HAVE to call the DR. If you dropped it off at 6pm and they close at 5, we do not control your DR's office hours. We can attempt to have him paged, but it will probably take a few hours to get a response. \n\nIf you have a coupon card for a freebie because your DR was persuaded by drug reps, READ THE FINE PRINT. Some of these have to be activated beforehand. Do this, and give it to me when you drop off the prescription. I have had patients hundreds of times tell me the DR said it would be free, when in fact, it just lowers your copay by 50$ or makes it free, WHICHEVER comes first.\n\nIf you had 2 weeks of pain medication filled at another pharmacy 1 week ago for your \"arm\" pain and have a nice shiny new prescription for more pain medication for your \"leg\" pain, we are not going to fill it.

And I believe in the rules and regulations that we're supposed to be enforcing - they're there for a reason, to ensure that there are no sweetheart deals or embezzlement.\n\nSo as long as you're working to get your project done, I'm going to bend over backwards to help you. But you have to be up front with me.\n\n1) Document. Whatever you did, document it. If you're not sure what to do, ask - but don't just ask, \"What should I do?\" Ask, \"What should I do, and how should I show it in the file?\" That's the kicker - your file has to tell a story so that we can go back and review as necessary, and if you have gaps in the project history, it's going to raise more questions.\n\n2) I'm not lying on timeframes. I will, to the best of my ability, tell you how long it will take *me* to walk your paperwork through our agency. It's your responsibility to know, especially after I've told you, how many other people ultimately touch your document, and to recognize that once it leaves my desk and my office, I have very little control over it...and things concentrate further along in the process, which means bottlenecks. There will be snags, especially when we're working together for multiple years. The smoothest ride we can hope for is that we know where everything is at all times, so please stop getting furious because of delays. In the end, I've never had anyone do stuff \"on time\" and not get their payments in a timely manner...though I've had plenty of people wait until the last minute and then get very angry that they're now getting yelled at by contractors. Also, note, this is not to say that I will not intercede on your behalf and make sure that things don't get lost. I want your people to get paid as much as you do, so come at it from a mindset of following up rather than complaining.\n\n3) Please, for the love of god, do some self audits. I will provide you with the materials that I use to check your files, so you can do it yourself and fix any deficiencies prior to even being audited. In fact, if you ask for it at the beginning, you'll probably be able to create your files based on how they will be reviewed. Which will save me time and you headaches. For the first time ever, I had someone do this, and it was fantastic. I had concerns that were mirrored in the self-audit, so I know that they're already working to correct it, and while I still have to write it up, I can write it up as a minor concern that requires follow up instead of a major concern that would require less palatable action.\n\n4) Answer shopping is not helpful. If I've told you you can't do something, I have probably given you a reason based in the law as I understand it. If you disagree, get your lawyer to write up an alternative justification, and I'll definitely see if our lawyers will sign off on it.

    "cckjhke": "Nurse Aide at a skilled nursing facility. In regards to my job, you helping me results in me giving your loved one better care, something I truly appreciate your help with. Most of the long term care patients I work with suffer from some dementia or confusion, so it's always a challenge to know them better.\n\n\nHere are some ideas how you can help me help them:\n\n\n1) Let us know what to do with their clothes. Do you want us to do their laundry? Do you want to do it? Make a sign with large type, hang it in the room and if you're taking the laundry home, if you can provide a basket, it is easier to keep track of a patient's garments that way.\n\n\n2) Give us as much information as you can--the more we know about your loved one, the more we can tailor care to their needs. If getting your mother out of bed every morning is consistently a challenge for us because she is combative, but we know that there is something that soothes her--a song, her knowing that you (who? we want to know who you are) have asked us to care for her, or maybe a reassurance we can provide (\"You will get coffee when you get up!\"), mornings will be easier for her and for us. I would love a book--if you could make a guide about your patient and leave it in plain view in their room, we can get a better idea of the person we're caring for and what is important to them and what they are particular about.\n\n\n3) Be involved. If you see something you want changed, talk to your patient's aide. We are happy to accommodate you--please treat us with respect and offer suggestions. Most aides are happy to be given tips (not talking monetary here). Let us know when you'll be by so we can reassure them. Bring lots of framed pictures and maybe some activities they would like to do during quiet time. If the facility allows, bring plants, a bedspread, anything homey that can make a room feel warm and things that remind the patient they are loved. \n\n\n4) Complain to the right person about the right thing. If you see that an aide hasn't done x, y, or z for your loved one yet, but you see that the aide is running non-stop, telling their supervisor your loved one is \"being ignored\" isn't always the best solution. Sometimes an aide may need help prioritizing, but more often than not the patient to aide ratio may be too high. Please try to be specific in your concerns and please do not haphazardly accuse aides of neglect. Usually when I have to make someone wait for something longer than a couple minutes, I feel bad about it already. Your guilt trip won't help anyone get anything faster. But seeking information about patient to aide ratio might put pressure on a facility to lower the number of patients per aide--and you moving your patient to a new facility which has a lower patient to aide ratio is a way of voting with your dollar.\n\n\nI don't know, that's just a start. I'd love to hear from more nurse aides with different perspectives.",

Please, for the love of god don't call me, unless it's absolutely time imperative.\n\nWhy? A few reasons:\n\n1. If you're giving me instructions for what you want, I want them written out so I can clearly read and understand them, save them for later, and ask you about specific parts by quoting you. This is far easier in an email\n\n2. Because generally when I'm creating software I'm deep in thought. When you call me, it takes me completely out of that zone, and it takes me quite a bit of time to get back into it. Your 5 minute phone call can cost me like 45 minutes of work. An IM or an email I can ignore until I'm ready (and usually I will start answering you within like 10 minutes).\n3. I probably hate your voice.\n\nThat said, the phone is good for things. Having group meetings is best in person or by phone. Getting \"everyone on the same page\" makes sense. But any instruction or question has a better tool than the phone. \n\nAlso, if I tell you I'm going to do something by a certain day/time, please don't ask me if it's done yet before then.

We'll take a look, and nine times out of ten, it's a very minor problem that we can fix right away.\n\n* **YOU MUST ACCOMPANY YOUR KIDS TO AN R-RATED MOVIE IF THEY ARE NOT SEVENTEEN.** They must have a valid ID **WITH THEM** to see it by themselves. If you buy the tickets, give them to your kids, and leave, I'm still going to kick them out. Your permission means nothing if you aren't there.^2\n\n* On that note, please control your kids. Shouting in a theater is annoying to other patrons and employees, and running in a theater is dangerous.\n\n* Yes, we will tell you to get off your phone during a movie. It's annoying, and just because I'm eighteen doesn't mean I'm afraid to ask a grown man to put his Blackberry away. By all means, feel free to leave and come back.\n\n* If you know you may need to leave more than once during your movie, please sit near the exit in a place that won't cause you to walk up and down the stairs/in front of others over and over. It's just common courtesy.\n\n* If I'm tearing tickets, you don't have to tell me what you're seeing, and you don't have to ask where it is (at least not at my theater). Say hello, give me your ticket, I'll read it, and I'll tell you exactly where to go.\n\n* Don't ever be afraid to tell us about someone disrupting your movie, but we can only ask them to leave if we witness it. We'll absolutely come into the theater and check, and we'll even keep checking if we need to, but we must witness the disturbance ourselves.\n\n* Your popcorn isn't stale until ten days after it's made, and it never stays in our building that long. It's probably only been there for five minutes, and we don't mind making another batch if we have to. We do have extra pre-made popcorn in the back room, but it's only for if we're incredibly low and we absolutely need it. Otherwise, it's ALL made that day and we keep it warm as best we can.\n\n* We have a website with our showtimes on it, specific to OUR theater. I don't care what Google or Fandango said, they aren't updated directly from our computers.\n\n* Emergency exits in the auditorium are for **EMERGENCIES**. They can easily get left open by someone trying to leave as quickly as possible, and that could lead to break-ins (not just someone sneaking in-- people can steal, vandalize, or even bring in firearms). After the shooting at the premier of the Dark Knight Rises, we were told to triple-check all exit doors when we checked theaters.\n\nSuperscript 1) We make almost no money from tickets. Our prices are high because we make almost ALL of our money from concessions. That drink and popcorn are expensive because it pays our power, water, wages, and pretty much everything else. At my theater, a box of candy is $4.25 not because we want to drain your wallet, but because we would shut down otherwise. We have specials, combos, matinees, sales, and rewards cards (free ones) to try to help you save money.\n\nSuperscript 2) You must be seventeen years of age AND have valid state-issued ID **with you** to get into an R-Rated movie. You may only buy more than one ticket if you are twenty-one or over. If you buy for your kids, they must be accompanied by someone who is at least twenty-one. These aren't the theater's rules, they are federal laws that apply to the entire US (before anyone asks, the government shutdown does not affect this rule). If I \"bend the rules\" to let a minor into a movie, I'm risking my job and committing a crime. Sorry, letting you in to see the Hangover 3 isn't worth my job.\n\nBasically, be cool and polite, practice movie etiquette, and follow the rules. Please.

We ***belong*** in that kitchen, by our own admission, and are very, very proud of that.  We also take great pride in every single plate we put in the pass.\n\nEveryone has a creative outlet.  To many of us behind the line, food is our creative outlet.\n\nFirst off, menu selections at decent restaurants are crafted by our Sous and Chefs to have a certain theme and flavor.  Everything in the dish goes toward that goal.  If we could leave it out and accomplish the same look, feel, and taste, trust me, we would.  Food profit margins are exceptionally thin, so every last bit on that dish is there for a reason.\n\nWe do not mind food allergies at all.  That is understandable, and something we're happy to help you with in any way we can.  Picky eaters, though, is something else entirely.  Your fad diet is something else entirely.\n\nAt my restaurant, a declared gluten allergy involves us double-checking the menu item carefully, a separate, clean cutting board and prep tools brought to the line, careful preparation, special cooking routines, and extreme separation of ingredients to ensure there is as little chance for cross-contamination as possible.\n\nTo then see that person chug down a goddamn beer next to their perfect little gluten-free meal is a total slap in the face and an insult.  You purposely made us go out of our way by lying to our server, forcing more work down our throats in the middle of a rush, just so you could follow a fad diet... that you're not actually following in the first place.  Just so you could feel superior and 'above' us lowly jackasses in the kitchen.  Fuck you too, buddy, fuck you too.  Thanks for slowing down and demoralizing the entire kitchen for kicks.\n\nIf you're a picky eater, that's fine.  Find something else on the menu that doesn't have whatever you're unreasonably afraid of.  I state it that way for a reason; while I wouldn't recommend a caprese salad to someone with lycopersicophobia right away, the little ones on your burger, salad, or pasta probably taste pretty good that way.  Don't instantly jump to 'modify my food special just so I feel special'.  We're already cooking it to order, there's no need for stuff like that.\n\nBe adventurous in your food choices.  Try something new from time to time.  Don't get hung up in one restaurant, on one dish.  We change menu every 3 months to keep it seasonal, fresh, and price-competitive.  We're not trucking in blueberries in the middle of winter, that way.  So when, for whatever reason, your 'favorite dish' goes away, try something new.  Realize that that one single dish may be good, but the rest of our menu is just as good!\n\nLet us make you something that will blow you away.  When you dictate menu to us, then complain it didn't taste good... You've just earned yourself a paddlin' out behind the dumpsters.  Stick around and keep poking the beast that is a dedicated cook, and we'll 'solve' the problem, and dispose of the body in the chili, and the other customers will *love* it.",

One I was bringing locomotives back from another railroad near midway airport traveling 25mph (track speed). I come around a blind corner to a crossing with a whistle prohibition. A car went around the raised divider and stopped on the tracks right in my path. I put the locomotive in emergency instantly and I didnt even have time to blow my horn. I stopped 7 feet from his driver side door. My quick reaction saved his life. One extra second and he would be gone. He drove away like nothing happened. The other was Christmas eve last year. I was coming thru a restricted speed area (45mph) in a small town with no warning lights. Just before I started to blow the whistle for the crossing a small pickup truck pulls on the tracks and stopped directly in my path. I frantically started whistling with no reaction by the driver. We got to the point where I was sure we were going to nail this guy. He looked right into my eyes and at the last minute started to pull away.

I will do everything in my power to fix it. I am fine when you ask me a \"stupid question,\" only to realize the answer for yourself as you're asking it. I'm even fine showing 10 different people over the course of the day where the same topic is in the nonfiction section. \n\nI will place holds, renew books, cancel holds, and update your account information even though you could do all of this faster online. I'll even extend your computer time past the two hour limit if we don't have a wait.\n\nThere are two things you can do to help me help you. \n\nThe first is simple enough. If I cannot help you, don't get in my face and say, \"My tax dollars pay your salary!\" They probably don't, and if they do, would you like your $1 back? Because that's probably more than you pay into the system. You're only funding this library if you own property in this county and pay property taxes. Even then, for every $100 you spend in property taxes, we get 5 cents. So why don't you calm your tits, and not get pissed at me when there is a waiting list 80 people deep for the book you want right now?\n\nThe second one--For the love of God, please don't watch porn on the public computers. There are some libraries (looking at you Seattle) that allow porn. That's fine. But I'm going to have to ask you to stop doing it here. I'm sorry if you don't have computer access at home, or if there's no other place where you can watch it. If we sold privacy screens and the policy was different, I'd be fine with it. But as it is, if I see a huge penis plowing a hairless vagina in a fullscreen close up shot as I did last week, then I am going to have to deal with this. I'm going to have to figure out who you are, then I'm going to have to get my boss, and then she is going to have to dedicate way too much time to catching you herself so she can ask you to leave. It is a hassle for everyone involved. And really? Videos of cute baby animals? Come on guy. We know what you're doing, and we know you know. So save us all the trouble and just leave.

Don't pay for a $2.00 coffee with a 20 dollar bill, it only takes 3-4 people to do this before the register has no more bills left. \n\n3. Don't ever order a Box of Joe in the Drive-Thru, all of the workers will be pissed, and all of the people behind you will be pissed because that shit takes time to make. Go inside. \n\n4. If you're going to order more than 4 sandwiches along with 4 coffees in the Drive-Thru, don't yell at us for being slow, it takes time, especially when the guy on the sandwich station likes to cook with fresh ingredients (not using any of the pre-cooked eggs or sausage that will sit in those containers for hours). Go inside.\n\n5. Don't immediately assume we're mentally slow because we work at Dunkin' Donuts. When you're ordering (most often this happens in the Drive-Thru) tell me what type of coffee you want, what size you want, and what you want in it - without pause. I can't keep track of how many times I get, \"Can I get a Medium Iced Caramel\" or \"Can I get a hot regular\" or \"Can I get a medium coffee.\" And that's all they say. Do you want it just black? What size do you want that? Is that a hot coffee or iced coffee? Unless the store is really bad, the person who is responsible for making the coffees is the fastest at making the coffees. This means that as you're speaking, they're making it. So when you pause like that it gets annoying because you're wasting time. \"So you want a Medium Iced Caramel? Just black?\" is how I usually respond to the first instance, to which they'll reply, \"No no no, cream and sugar.\" Well, sorry - I can't read minds. If one were to say, \"May I have a Medium Iced Caramel with cream and sugar.\" In one swift sentence, the coffee would be made and ready before you even left the speaker. Please people, it goes by that much faster if you're as fast and as detailed as possible!  \n\nAlso a Pro Tip: If you decide to come to DD in the afternoon (around 3pm) and you see there's a couple of cars in the Drive-Thru but nobody inside the store, go through the Drive-Thru. The Afternoon shift (at least at the one I work at) has only 2 or 3 people working the shift, all 3 people will usually work together to deal with the Drive-Thru, but whenever a person comes into the store, that immediately takes 1 person away from the Drive-Thru to deal with that customer, and now there's only 2 people working the Drive-Thru, and if 1 person always has to be at the register for the Drive-Thru,  that means the other guy has to take orders, make coffees, and make sandwiches all by himself. It slows the process down, you will more likely than not get your things faster going through the Drive-Thru in the afternoon instead of going inside the store when there's people in the Drive-Thru, because all of the workers will be helping in completing your order.

The majority of our time spent on 911 followup is for hangups...cellphones make that a longer process. \n*Each emergency services dispatch center has a finite number of 911 lines. 911 is for Emergencies only..in progress Crimes and in progress danger to lives/property.  Key phrase here is IN PROGRESS (or Just Occurred, within last 5-10 minutes)  my car was stolen overnight, somebody used my credit card 2 hours ago etc does not justify tying up a 911 line, there is probably somebody on hold who has just been stabbed in the heart while you are telling your story.\n*You should also know that in A LOT of cities, when you call 911 you get the police, if you need an ambulance or a fire truck they might have to transfer you to another 911 center. \nKeep your comments short and to the point; \"I need an ambulance in (insert city here)\" \"my house is on fire in (insert city here)\" \nI know if you are calling 911 you are likely stressed, the quickest way to get help is to keep your comments short and to the point. Your call won't be dispatched until the dispatcher knows EXACTLY where and WHY they are sending you help. If you ramble, don't answer questions, you are only delaying your help. In a true 911 situation the dispatcher doesn't need to know about the 2 year family dispute that has led to your uncle currently stabbing your cousin. All we care about is what is happening RIGHT NOW.  \"911 what is your emergency?\" \"my uncle is stabbing my cousin\" then answer the dispatchers questions short and sweet as they are asked to you. \n*Once the dispatcher has the where and what, the call has usually already been sent to the radio operator to dispatch, you talking to the dispatcher isn't delaying response. Not answering questions or repeatedly saying \"just get them here\" may delay officers entering the scene, they have a job to do and they go through lots of training to do it, they can't do anything without information. \n*Most of the time they DON'T need your zip code when they ask for your address.\n*You know that traffic accident you just drove by? Chances are there are another 20 people calling 911 about it also. 20 callers, 8 available 911 lines, 5 available dispatchers to answer.  PLEASE STILL CALL....just make it short and sweet \"do you have the car accident at such and such location?\" Don't be offended if the dispatcher says Yes and hangs up on you, they have a crap load of other 911's on hold and alarms going off and need to triage quickly through them because one of them is probably the guy who's been stabbed in the heart (remember him?)\n\"911 what's your emergency?\" \"i'm following the suspect vehicle in the hit and run at such and such location\" will move things along smoothly also.\n* CELL PHONES ARE USELESS LOCATORS. If you're calling 911 on a cellphone and you don't know where you are..I don't know where you are.  Verizon and maybe Sprint are the only providers that get your location GENERALLY correct, and I can only speak for my city so just go with the theory that your cellphone is useless at telling me where you are.

    "cckk3jr": "Game developer here. Learn what \"lag\" is.\n\nBetter yet: don't use the word \"lag\". Ever. A lot of game developers have gotten to the point where they ignore it. Here's a list of more useful terms.\n\n**Latency**: If you're playing a multiplayer game, and you try to shoot a dude in the face, and your gun finally goes off two seconds later, that's latency. If you're playing a singleplayer game and your actions always feel a bit muddy and delayed, that might be latency. Latency is a delay between your actions and your character's behavior. It might be caused by bad code, a bad network between you and the server, overloaded servers, or a combination of the three. There's probably not much you can do about it, but please report it. If there's a thread with a thousand people reporting it, we already know about it, you don't have to chime in.\n\n**Bad framerate**: If the video is choppy or looks like a slideshow, that's a bad framerate. You should try lowering your video settings. This may not help. If you have a computer that dates back from the time of the dinosaurs, you should probably upgrade (CPU, GPU, or entire computer.) If your computer is relatively new, try updating drivers, do a virus scan, and get rid of McAfee. If that doesn't help, please compare the behavior with *similar* games. If similar games don't run better, then the problem is probably on your end. If similar games run much better, please report it.\n\n**Framerate hitches**: If your gameplay is *mostly* smooth, but once in a while the whole game locks up for a tenth of a second (or more!), then that's a framerate hitch. There's a reasonable chance that an action of yours is causing this - opening a dialog box, for example. There's also a reasonable chance that something else is causing it. If you're running lots of other programs at the same time, try turning them off. If you have an old computer, upgrading your RAM may help considerably. If other games don't have the same behavior it's almost certainly the developer's fault and you should report it.\n\nIn all cases, reproduction steps are vital! Here's what I would *love* to see:\n\n&gt; * Log on to the server\n&gt; * Make a Dark Elf Warrior\n&gt; * Find a Sleepy Boar\n&gt; * Position the camera so the Sleepy Boar takes up most of the screen\n&gt; * Use Elven Depression on the Sleepy Boar\n&gt; * Watch for a major framerate hitch\n\n*oh my god if you report it this way I love you*. The more details you can give, the faster we can find the bug; the faster we can find it, the faster we can fix it; the faster we can fix it, the more time we have to devote to new features and new content.\n\nIf your bug report consists of mostly profanity and no actual description of the problem, I hate you, go away.\n\ntl;dr: never say \"lag\" again",

I can't tell you how many theaters I've cleaned (by myself) where it takes five extra minutes to walk around and pick up all the trash people left behind, even though the garbage cans were right in front of them. understand that the ushers do more than clean up after you - we maintain the security of the building, kick people out of their movies when necessary, keep the *entire* floor clean, and help behind the vending stand when it gets super busy. in addition, the only time we have more than one usher is on the weekends; throughout the course of a weekday, one person is responsible for cleaning all of the theaters and keeping the building secure. the movies usually begin and end close together, meaning that the usher has to rush from one theater to the next when cleaning before people come in and take their seat (and if the usher is cleaning when you walk in, please be courteous and wait until we're finished... that, and it's really awkward if you're just sitting there relaxing and watching me clean).

The people doing this work get paid shit and tend to be overqualified and overworked. Rather than complaining or getting upset when mail or email arrives here are some tips:\n\n1) When you sign up for mailing lists be explicit about how you don't want your info used in writing. E.g. Don't trade it, only email me, no phone calls, only info re: volunteering. Only and No are the most important words here. If you don't say so, the groups will use your data any other way that your info can be used. And again, make sure its written down, often the people taking your info down aren't the ones entering or using it.\n\n2) if your data is being misused try and talk to the lowest paid/responsible person who can help. Or even easier, just have it returned to sender and write those Nos and Onlys on the envelope. If you just talk to anyone it'll probably get someone in needless trouble and be blown out of proportion. The fundraisers don't typically know the ins and outs of the data or how it's managed and one complaint can lead to audits that can waste lots of people's time and lead to finger pointing for no reason.\n\n3) If you move, change jobs, etc. and want the groups to know, tell them.

You don't need to lose it all at once, but you do need to change your lifestyle, not just \"diet.\" The majority of chronic pain and chronic illness can be tied back to your weight, and obesity is completely preventable and curable, typically for free.\n2. If you want to watch doctor shows, or listen to talk show \"experts,\" or get your information on the internet, remember...they're doing it for viewers, readers and advertisers; they're in it for money.

Please, bring your open-minded questions from all those different sources, but understand their motivations for giving you the information, and also realize our motivation is to use our years of focused learning to actually help (yes, really).\n3.

    "cckgo9d": "Corporate IT, for a long time. If I'm attending to you, you're a corporate worker and something just went squirrelly with your computer.\n\nThe #1 thing you can do is to know what issues are actually the IT department's responsibility. For instance, it's usually not the IT department's responsibility to train you on how to use your assigned office equipment. That means that if you don't know how to use your computer to do your job, it's your boss's responsibility to teach you. If you think about it, there's actually a good chance that the IT department *hasn't* been informed how to do each and every step of each and every job in the entire company. Ask your colleagues first.\n\nIn addition, you are supposed to know how to switch your computer off and back on again. Again, your boss or co-workers should be teaching you this. If your computer is having a problem, it's the first thing you should be trying. Please note that this is not (just) us being lazy; it's usually much faster to restart your computer than to call the IT department, wait on hold for 20 minutes, and then be told to restart your computer anyway, because that's the first thing we're going to try, too. And the reason it's our go-to action is that it tends to resolve about 75% of all reported problems. So please, for your sake and ours, restart your computer AND, VERY IMPORTANTLY, check to see if the problem still exists before picking up the phone to call us.\n\n**PLEASE, PLEASE, READ** any message which comes up when you try and do whatever it is you're trying to do on your computer. 90% of the time, they will tell you *exactly* what you need to do to fix the problem, because it will have been written by the IT department for people in exactly your situation. Don't just call IT because \"there's some kind of message on the screen\". Read the message, follow the instructions, if you're not sure how to follow the instructions then check with your workmates or boss, who may have seen that message before.\n  \n\u00a0  \n  \nIf you have an actual, genuine computer problem which is not resolved by restarting the computer, and it's not something your co-workers or boss already know how to address, then there are three things we'd really like you to have on hand before you call us:\n\n- your corporate username. This should be the name you type into your computer every single morning to log on, if the IT policies at your workplace are even half-competent. If you're not sure what it is, check with your team or boss, because it should be part of your employee training.\n\n- the unique name of your computer. In a properly-run company, this will probably be on an asset sticker on the side or front of the computer. If not, please check with your team or manager as to where to find it.\n\n- whether or not this problem is affecting anyone else in your immediate area. Something affecting only your computer usually has different causes *and solutions* than something affecting every computer in your team. If we have an accurate picture of the scope of the problem, we can fix it faster.\n\n(I should add that if you are working from home, or otherwise remotely offsite, the fourth thing to do before calling IT is to check whether or not you can access two or three external websites. Google and Yahoo will do fine. What comes up on the screen when you try to do so will help the IT department narrow down the cause of your issue a lot faster.)\n  \n\u00a0  \n  \nFollowing these steps, and encouraging colleagues to do the same, will mean that when you genuinely do need to call the IT department, you'll probably be able to get through right away, instead of having to wait in line behind all the staff who *didn't* follow these steps and are wasting their time, the IT department's time, and most importantly, **your** time.",

Over a 72 month loan, that makes a difference of about $3/month.  \n\nPeople waste so much time \"dickering\" with salesmen over a few hundred bucks.  Then when they can't come to terms, they'll spend $500 worth of food, gas, and expenditures to go somewhere else and deal with another salesman and play another game to save that $250.  It's very counter-productive.\n\nDo your research...there is plenty of it out there online.  If the car dealer offers you a fair price, take it.  If they don't, make them an offer.  If you have to get up and leave because you are being treated unfarily, then do-so. But don't try to get blood out of a turnip.  This is the only business where people consistently expect you to sale them something and not make a dime of profit on it. \n\nAlso consider that if you think the price is too high, you may be biting off more than you can chew.

However, for most of us its really hard to be approached in public like that. \nSee, the Army is its own culture. It changes the way you think and talk. It changes what you find funny. It even changes peoples accents. We become so indoctrinated in it that most of us don't even know it. When you're in  basic and AIT, living on post, stationed in a foreign country, deployed you spend most of your time surrounded by fellow soldiers who think and talk like you. You also have the aspect of PTSD which adds another edge to being in public. It basically turns us into social clams when civilians are around because we have no idea how to talk to you.  For a lot of us walking through a grocery store can be a nightmare. And going anywhere in uniform turns us into a walking D-list celebrity. \nAnd you know, the thank yous for your service don't bother me. It may make me feel super uncomfortable but it makes me feel better. Its the ignorance of some people that get to me. \n\"Have you killed someone?\"\n\"Are you Republican?\"\nOr coming up and telling us why this war is crap and talking about the President or blaming us for all of it when all we do is work, just like you. \nI have a friend with a service dog for PTSD. She was blown up several times, is a combat medic. We go to Costco. Everyone is staring, trying to pet the dog. We are both wearing Army tshirts and its pretty obvious our profession. But as we stand in line I overhear some overconfident woman telling strangers about how they give service dogs to mentaly handicapped who can't live on their own and how my friend must be retarded. I almost lost my shit. \nBottom line, we love to hear your thanks. It makes us feel like we are appreciated.  But keep the questions to yourself. Half the time we either can't answer or its rude. You don't go asking random strangers if they've killed someone so please don't ask us. And if we come of as ungrateful or awkward its probably because we aren't used to talking to you. ",

    "cckkcjq": "I work in retail and used to work in a bar.\n\n&lt;When in shops of any kind&gt;\n\n1) First and foremost. Don't treat people who work in retail like they're idiots. I have a Bachelors degree and a Masters degree but I'm working minimum wage in sports chain in Ireland. I, and most of the people who I work with, are not actually idiots compared to how some people treat us. Most of us are actually well educated and are in transit periods in our life (financial reasons) before persuing internships and employment in our specialist areas. You would really be surprised at the amount of people working those minimum wage jobs that are well educated and actually want to, and will, amount to more than most of their customers ever will.\n\n2) Don't patronize people working those crappy jobs either. Reasons same as above.\n \n3) Have some manners and even if you have a right to be pissed off at the store you are in for whatever reason, don't ever, EVER take it out on the person you're dealing with. We may all be wearing a uniform, but uniformity does not apply. We may represent the company we are working for, but we are individuals, and we are usually not the gobshite who has caused your specific inconvenience. One asshole can ruin your day working in retail. \n\n4) If you have kids, control them. Its not my job to clean up after your kids wreck the shop. However, I still have to do it, multiple times every day. \n\n5) If you have kids, and if you are buying shoes or clothes for them, don't give them too much control over what they get. (I'm talking young kids here) The time this wastes everyday for me is ridiculous as we sell kids shoes and trainers too. \n\n6) Don't ever click your fingers at me. \n\n&lt;When you're in a bar&gt; \n\n1) If you're at the bar and want to be served, don't get pissed off when the bar man/woman skips you because you were turned talking to your friends behind you when they walked past you. \n\n2) When the staff member comes to take empty glasses from your table, place them close to them. Don't have them bend over you. This can cause a spillage and of course they would get blamed for spilling a drink, just because you couldn't have bothered your arse to move your empty glasses less than two feet. \n\n3) Please, please, aim for the bowl when you're in the jacks. No matter what it is you're doing in there. \n\n4) Pretty much all rules under the 'when you're in a shop of any kind' are also applicable in bars bar the ones relating to children. \n\n\nEDIT: One more thing to add. Every time you're in big retail outlets or generally anywhere where the staff are going to be people working for minimum wage in a crappy job for a crappy company that probably has a lovely face on for its customers but probably treats its own staff really crappy, just go out of your way to be nice to them. They may look miserable. They probably are. But they're alright people. They probably started their day in a good mood, looking forward to when they don't have to do this crap anymore. But before you they probably either dealt with a customer who made them feel very small, or with a manager who they're probably twice as educated as giving them hassle over something meaningless. Just by going out of your way to be nice to them you will probably have completely changed how they will feel when they get home from work. One ass-hole can ruin your day in those jobs, but believe me, one absolute gentleman or lady will do the direct opposite and will get you through another mundane and slow day feeling quite happy. The difference that makes is immeasurable. \n",

Do this as soon as possible. ..Do not shower or change clothes or eat if you can help it.  Try to preserve any biological material from your attacker: forced oral cop... spit it out and collect it in tissue or on your clothes and hand it over as evidence; he bled somewhere... point it out for collection.  Do not wait seven days to report it.  Be honest and thorough about what happened to the nurse who examines you and takes evidence samples. Be honest about any sexual activity you had prior to or after the rape. Do not lie because you are embarrassed; they have heard it all. Be honest about drug and alcohol use and memory loss. ... they will sample all usual areas (more work for us but better than missing the evidence). Be honest if you are a sex worker... it will help us understand the evidence. It is no more ok to rape a prostitute than any other person. ... especially if you are under the age of consent. Remember: If it is never collected it can never be tested. Understand that police investigators and crime labs are severely overworked. We will get to your case. That being said, it doesn't hurt to be a squeaky wheel. If a long time passes please cooperate with the DA.... it may be painful to revisit the incident, but if you refuse to cooperate they may drop the case and your rapist may be left free to rape others.
