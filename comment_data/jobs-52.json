I'd say it's about a 6/10.  My schedule is very easy, the work is second nature, and most of the kids are sweet and fun to work with.  However, communication with management is a huge problem.  I'm never told anything about new classes and schedule changes until the very last minute; often our own students are told before we are.  On several occasions, I had to hear about a new class or schedule change FROM my students because my boss didn't bother telling me.  It's kind of a power/control issue.  If he doesn't tell you stuff until the last minute, he basically holds you in a state of limbo where you can't make other plans because he hasn't decided yet.  \n\nAlso, living in China but not being in a major metropolitan area has it's good side and bad side. It's good because you can experience how most everyday Chinese people live their lives.  The nouveau riche are pretty thin on the ground in these parts, though working at the only foreign school in the city means I see a higher percentage of them than a regular person might.  The things that suck most about it is that you start to crave any food that's not Chinese, and that can be really hard to find around here.  And if you can find it, it's not going to taste anything like how you expect it to. Mi haven't had decent cheese is nearly 2 years.
