There are rules involved in how you can do this. An example could be a bowling alley. (all these numbers are made up for illustration purposes). We need to buy bowling pins so we spend $10,000 on 10,000 bowling pins. Even though your bank account has $10,000 withdrawn from it, you can't **recognize** the spending of that money immediately. You have to **match** the expense to the period when the revenue is earned (in accounting we do this by month - as opposed to daily, or hourly, or any other time measurement). So you're allowed to use a logical **basis** of expense recognition. In this case what makes the most sense is how long the average bowling pin lasts (let's say 10 months). So you **recognize** $1,000 of bowling pin expense each month for 10 months, until all $10,000 is exhausted. If the bowling pins last longer, that's fantastic, but it won't have an accounting impact - maybe just a financial one because you don't have to buy more bowling pins. There are other **bases** to match expenses and revenue like usage (cleaning supplies), percentage complete (construction), and others. Many of these rules are made by regulating bodies. In the US accounting is generally self regulating by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have a few different rules if you're a public company and than the ultimate regulator is the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) so a lot of times a company will have to report expenses and revenues in several different ways. \n\nNow that you know the basics... My job is basically to make sure my company recognizes expenses and revenues in the period when they are incurred (expenses) and earned (revenue). \n\nThis thread is a great start for you, and let me just remind you that Google is your best friend (a close second is Wikipedia). I pretty much was exactly like you at your age. Everyone I knew was blue collar and I had no clue what people did at their office jobs.

When grantees send in reports to trigger installments, I read the report, compare it to the original project proposal, and if everything looks good, draft an installment letter for review by the CEO or grants officers. If there's a problem, or if grantees are late in their reporting, I get to try to follow up with them.\r\n\r\nI also help facilitate the three-step application process, which takes about four months, from start to finish.

There's always a but though, and it's time pressure. You get X hours to do a job and it better be good in that time. And if it turns out to be a clusterfuck that they tendered far, far too low for you're still getting shit for going over the X hours needed to make the partner a profit from it.

I then submit these to the local security guys, IT contacts, and business owners, and then a herd of magic fluorescent monkeys goes and tracks whether the stuff gets done.  \n\nThis is done to a small degree because people understand that doing stupid shit on the cheap exposes you to potential business loss, but primarily because a lot of laws now say that banks and companies have to be really careful about following certain processes (such as having a person like me who can explain in a reasonably objective, understandable way, what could go wrong and what can be done to fix it.)\n\nAt other times, I help train people in security best practices, I explain to managers why security is a good thing and will help them make more money, I write the above policies, help manage product design, and post on reddit a lot.  \n\nI'd rather own a bar, though.",

    "c1j5q4d": "OK, so I'm a computer programmer.  And I've had desk jobs pretty much since I started my career.  I started out in desk jobs by being a temp. (temporary worker).  And much of this kind of work was centered around filing things alphabetically, delivering mail in the office, stuffing envelopes, doing data entry, and some light accounting work.\n\nIf you are interested in a desk job, I'd look into temp agencies and take on a few different jobs.  It's a great introduction to the office world because it exposes you to many different kinds of companies, their cultures, and how offices work generally.  As a female, you could probably find easy work being a secretary or as a receptionist.\n\nJust keep in mind, however, that most temp jobs are dead-end jobs.  And yes, they are truly temporary and provide *no benefits*.  My advice to you is to shop around, find what you like and after a year or so, start looking for a permanent job with benefits and a 401K program.\n\nWhat got me interested in programming was that I graduated from college in January 1995, and I was living in San Francisco.  So, at that time, people I knew could get paid $25/hr. for doing straight HTML \"programming.\"  Those days are long gone, but programming still pays quite well.  The trade-off is, most of what you know may be replaced by newer technology every 2-3 years - so there's lots of learning on your own.  Still, I personally think it's easier than being a factory worker.\n\nAnyway, that's what I would recommend if you want an office job.  Move to a big city and you'll find lots of temp jobs in corporate offices.  You may even be able to use your charm to wiggle into a permanent job.  Or at least you can find out more from inside.  My greatest recommendation is that you move to a big city, make lots of friends, work in offices, date a lot of cute boys, and have as much fun as you possibly can!  \n\nBut keep in mind that there is a ceiling for those who do not have a college degree.  So if you're not planning on going to college now, you really should make a goal for yourself to have a bachelor's degree by the time you're 30.  Otherwise, your salary trajectory will flatten out fairly soon.",

That means he wakes up at 8:45, and only has to turn the phone on and log into the computer to start working, no commuting (or other people seeing you, so he can stay in his pajamas all day if he's lazy).

My primary job is to figure out how to process non-standard wastes to make safe for burial. Most \"nuclear waste\" is not the green glowing goo you see in the Toxic Avenger, but rather incidentally contaminated items like gloves, hammers, water, etc. Things that come into contact with radioactive substances, then have the potential to have surface contamination. This is the easy stuff. Its burned, melted, or boiled, and the radioactive residues encased in concrete and buried in the desert. The hard stuff are things like reactive metals, PCB containing materials, Beryllium, and other dangerous, non-standard wastes. That's where I come in.\n\nI design processes and treatment methods that handle the worst stuff that comes in. Often, that means a lot of research, especially for safety design. I also spend a lot of time drawing up designs for small scale systems used to process the material. Often, I will also dress out in contamination gear to assist in the processing (since I know the dangers, and would not expect my crew to do anything I am not willing to myself).\n\nIn regards to how I got to this job, I went to college for Chemical Engineering. After graduating, I worked at a cement plant for a few years as a process engineer. That job was hot, dirty, and difficult, and did not leave a lot of time for computer work. I was laid off, unemployed for nearly a year during the financial crap, then found this job. As much fun as cement lung would have been, I am pretty okay with being irradiated every day.\n\nSo, finally, why do I get to surf reddit so much? The government is slow, and so are people who contract with the government. I spend most of my day waiting on people I work with (HR, Safety, Health Physics, and other Management) to get me information I need to do my job. They don't like to call me back, because I make them work. Hence, lots of reddit gets surfed.\n\ntl;dr - I work for a nuclear waste disposal company and surf reddit because my coworkers never call me back.",

This will go on for about a month in order to get them all tested. The results will have to be registered, a new batch of rejections will have to be sent out. A new metric shit-ton of complaints will have to be received, assessed and responded to. At this point in the process, some people decide to lawyer up. That means that for every response to a complaint we send out, some sort of stalling-tactic will be deployed before we receive a counter-complaint about the new decision, often while an attorney is grasping madly for straws. This process can run on for months, as they try to come up with new ideas about what we have done wrong to their client. \n\nWhile corresponding with attorneys and applicants on a weekly basis, we will also try to do a second round of scoring of the applicants, in order to make sure that all scores are calculated correctly, and then admit the best applicants. This would be in mid-July, trying to sort things out before early August. Applicants will forget to respond to the offer of admission, or turn it down as they have found something else they rather want to do. So for the next eight weeks, there will be a whole lot of work with swapping people around.

However, Marvel is not in the business of making toys, apparel, party supplies, etc.  Someone has to reach out to companies that DO make those things to create deals where Marvel will get a percentage.  There is licensing for sports franchises.  There is licensing to get movies made from properties.  There is licensing for all sorts of consumer products.  There is licensing of celebrities (Bieber T-Shirts).  There is even fashion licensing (when you see name brands housed in a retailer, it is possible they just bought product from the company, but it is also possible that they licensed the brand to create products and sell clothes).\n\nLicensing is a bigger world than what I just described about though.  There are licensing agencies (much like marketing agencies) that handle brands and there are all sorts of players, licensors, licensees, etc.  The other great thing is that there is usually a marketing component as well so two companies (plus, sometimes an agency) get to work together to market and promote the products.",

It was cool.\n\nThen a big corporation bought the startup. It gave me the opportunity to sit even more at my computer to work on a big project. Did you see those [commercials](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2g4grPwE1U) for Intuit Websites on TV? The startup I was working for started that shit and I created the Online Promotion option you can add on to your website. Intuit makes millions out of that option.

They sell paper.  Mostly they do it over the phone, but sometimes they do it in person.  The buyers are other offices mostly.\n\nPam: Used to be the receptionist, answering phones all day and doing some secretarial work.  Now she's the office administrator, making sure everybody has the supplies and equipment they need to do their jobs.\n\nRyan: many things but probably currently a salesman.\n\nKevin, Angela, Toby: accountants.\n\nToby, Holly: HR\n\nMost of the people in the office spend their time arranging contracts to deliver paper to various offices in the area.  When they arrange new contracts, the contract information is given to the accountants who keep track of how much money is coming in, how much is going out, what the various costs are, etc.  Even though it's a much crazier office than any real one, the HR rep's job is obvious, smooth over problems between employees, hire people, fire people, discipline people.  Throughout all this, the boss is trying to motivate people, respond to the requests of his bosses, look for new sales opportunities, etc.\n\nTLDR: even though \"The Office\" is a sitcom, underneath it all is an example of a typical office workplace, with the kinds of desk jobs that a lot of people actually have.\n",

Utilization is basically a breakdown of the hours equipment is used, the cost to use it, and the hours that workers work. \r\n\r\nThere is a *LOT* of downtime. Yesterday I browsed the internet the entire day because I am waiting on corporate/IT to finish some things as they want me to wait until its complete before invoicing again. - This is because I was moved from one location to another in order to separate the two so that the company can see what money is coming from where - as there were some problems in the past. The \"things\" that corporate/IT are working on are vital to the separation.\r\n\r\nI don't want to sound like I'm bragging, but I have no clue how to word this so I'll just tell it how it is. Back on the downtime subject -&gt; I also have a lot of downtime because I am fairly quick at invoicing. If I have 50 tickets to invoice out I can usually do them in an hour or two if I'm feeling good - while other workers often take the entire day or two days. I've got so many things hotkeyed and I'm working on getting a bunch of hotstrings set up so that invoices are taking me less and less time every day - as I have to do less research and looking up to find missing information since I have it \"archived\" in hotstrings and such. Its pretty nifty.\r\n\r\nOh yeah not to mention since I moved I live 10 minutes from home rather than 30-45, get to leave 2 hours earlier, and still get paid for 40 hours.\r\n\r\nI completely lucked out with my job.
