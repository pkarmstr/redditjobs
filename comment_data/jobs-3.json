The lack of monotony is a big plus, there's not one day that I'll be redoing a task unless of course the Artistic Director decides something needs a change. Coworkers are great, fun people who share the same passion as you, sure there are some assholes but they're everywhere right?

I was going up in the company but I never truly enjoyed the positions I had. After 6 years and hating to waking up to go to work for a job that bored me to death I knew things had to change. I noticed the artist in me was crying to come out. So I made a sacrifice. I quit my job, sold my condo and moved back to the ol' folks home for a bit (since I no longer had any income) to go back to school in a game design and art program.

It's not a babysitting job like at the main store, the associates know what needs to get done and they do it, leaving me to take care the paperwork and making sure equipment and what not is working. What makes a job miserable is the person that manages you. I've had two managers who had no people skill, so associates would all come to me and expect me to play referee on a daily basis. It gets a bit stressful when the manager is your personal friend; yet when you tell her what her problem is, she denies the way she speaks to the associates. When your manager does not know how to take constructive criticism, your job is pretty much shitty. One time I suggested she order bags because I knew how long it took sometimes to get to us during the holidays (a few weeks); she said no, we had enough and to let her know when it gets down to a few boxes. Well, black Friday came and we ran out of bags, warehouse didn't have it and it took 2 weeks to get us some.

I love my work.\n\nI was employed by ASDA (read: WAL*MART UK) for about 2 years doing shopping deliveries in one of [THESE](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/A_Brand_New_ASDA_Mercedes_Benz_Sprinter_Delivery_Van.jpg) bad boys, and I have to say I loved my job for the most part. There's nothing better than winding down the windows and blasting music as I drove, almost care-free, along the streets of my local town.\n\nThe customers were nice, most of the time, and even when it was chucking it down with rain, or when the snow was thick and plentiful (well... by UK standards, anyway) I thoroughly enjoyed what I did.\n\nThe only parts that I didn't like (and, ultimately, leading to my resignation) were the other workers. Those who were picking the shopping from the store were lazy and slow - if I had an early morning shift (which was often the case), *nothing* would be ready in time for my first deliveries, so the mornings were always spent making up time, which I relished most of the time.\n\nThe people who were employed to load the shopping onto the vans were also quite lacklustre in their efforts. I sympathised with them sometimes, due to them being taken away from their own jobs to do that of the pickers, who were constantly lagging behind.\n\nUnsurprisingly, that lead to the drivers having to load their own vans most mornings. This isn't something that particularly bothered me, and I'm very happy to help out on busy occasions, but when it's an average day then you should be expected to complete your part of the job at least, which very rarely happened in our store.\n\nIt breaks down like this. Pickers did next to nothing, loaders had to do the pickers' jobs, whilst the drivers had to do both the loaders' jobs and the driving job, which was viewed as largely unfair by most of the drivers.\n\nYou know how it goes, though. Nobody agrees with what is going on, but nobody will speak up about it. That's where I come in, and this is how I ended up on bad terms with the manager and quite a few others. I wasn't afraid to call out the situation and the manager's reluctance to resolve *any* problems with the department.\n\nLike I said, I'm happy to pick up the pieces when it's a genuinely busy day and things are lagging, but not when people are being downright lazy and/or sloppy. Often I was pulled to one side for my unwillingness to, essentially, do everyone else's job and, no matter how often I explained that I shouldn't have to do other people's work, *I* was the one taking the fall.\n\nThe most memorable experience of this is one Sunday afternoon. Everything was late, nobody was doing any work and the drivers were the ones having to deal with the angry customers asking why their deliveries were **4 HOURS** late. Being a Sunday, our first runs weren't due out til 11am, our second runs weren't out until about 1pm, finish was approximately 4pm.\n\nAstonishingly, I managed to make up quite a lot of time on the road, but the whole ordeal had left me in one hell of a bad mood. What made it worse was the fact that the pickers and loaders had left for home bang on finishing time. I thought to myself 'fine, I'll just take the van back at 4pm and be done - that's the end of my shift'. My manager had other ideas, though.\n\nCue a large argument about how lazy I am, and that if I didn't complete my job he would be taking me up for yet another warning/disciplinary/etc., at which point I blew up in his face - in front of pretty much everyone on the department - about what a hypocrite he was, about how he's quite happy to let everyone else go home as soon as their time is up, yet when a driver like myself attempts to do the same, it's not allowed and is a disciplinary matter.\n\nAfter that it just wasn't the same, which sucks, because as I said, I really enjoyed the job, but after that I always got the shitty end of the stick. The shitty end of the stick, in our case, is giving us only a handful of deliveries, phonecalls saying you're not needed (which didn't really work due to me, by contract, not having to accept the unpaid day off) and every effort possible to reduce hours of work, thus reducing overall income.\n\nEventually, it came to a point where to make up hours, I was driving home for breaks and manipulating the system in whatever ways I could to earn just a little bit more money. This is when I, essentially, lost my job. They pulled me up about 'stealing company time' and 'misuse of company property' (i.e. driving the van off-route). I explained as best I could the situation to those dishing out the punishment, and used the time to just get every gripe I had about the job off my chest.\n\nThey seemed to reluctantly agree *off the record*, but due to the evidence they had against me actually performing acts of gross misconduct, I figured their hands were tied and I handed my notice in before they had the opportunity to say I was sacked.\n\nA horrible end to a wonderful job.\n\nThis will always be the type of job I go for, though. I came lucky in that I got a tax rebate of \u00a33000. Apparently I was being charged roughly \u00a3100 a MONTH in taxes MORE than I should have been, for about 2 and a half years (how I didn't notice, I'll never know).\n\nI used this money to pay for courses in LGV/HGV lorry driving. I wanted to make a 'career' out of driving lorries, maybe work for Eddie Stobart, or drive petrol tankers for BP, that sort of thing. Unfortunately, I've been well and trully screwed over there, too.\n\nSeems the 'company' I went through were complete scammers. The only time they ever did anything for me was when I called for my money back. I now have my LGV, but not my CPC, so I've pretty much gotten nowhere in about a year. I've been too patient. They still have about \u00a31,500 of my money that hasn't been utilised, and now they won't reply to letters or e-mails and their phonelines divert to an answering machine that states they won't be open til August 30th (which was weeks ago now). So I'm off to citizens advice bureau to see what I can do about them.\n\nPainfully, this has stripped me of the enthusiasm I once had for taking that career path. However, I have decided that I would like to do something I feel would be a lot more worthwhile. I want to do something that I feel would be more self-rewarding. I want to be a paramedic. I want to drive the ambulances that help save people's lives, I think this would give my life the meaning that it seems to be missing at present.\n\nI need a new job - any job (anyone know of anything interesting I can apply for which essentially requires no qualifications at all?

But he used the much higher pay scale as an incentive.\n\nI told him that I might make less money, but I actually enjoyed my job and wasn't stressed out all the time like he was. Eventually he was forced into early retirement by a very bad turn of events at the company. The stress he went through leading up to the forced retirement was so great that everyone in the family was legitimately concerned that he would have a heart attack. Thankfully he's fine now and much happier fishing.\n\nMoney helps, I know. I need to pay my mortgage and the bills. But I'll always trade higher pay for higher happiness.\n\n**EDIT:** I want to add that my first cousin who never completed college was recently promoted to being the president of a company where he had originally been hired to work in the business office. I was more than a bit jealous and annoyed by this because I slogged my way through college to get a Masters Degree (and a lot of debt).  A few months ago my cousin phoned to tell me he took a buyout from his company because he hated the job. He said the stress was too high and his wife told him that it wasn't worth staying there. She apparently used me as an example of being happier in a lower paying job. Though, I think his buyout probably insured him from any great financial problems for awhile.",

To this end, I work with a lot of fantastic people...it's a 500 person organization, but if anything bad happens to anyone, everyone is concerned. Note: it's not _because_ it's a non-profit that people are good, it's the hiring mind set, and being a non-profit contributed to that.\n\nThis is a vast change from when I worked at a corporation, where they were interested in bottom lines. In those cases, work was miserable because nobody cared about you, and managers _only_ cared about getting the numbers they were supposed to get, so it was a punish-the-bad situation, with no reward for the good.

    "c2p6mmp": "Well, my comments are a bit cynical, but here we go:\n1. At career day, people who probably hated their jobs were telling you all about what they do for a living. They probably were thrilled to actually not be at their workplace, but might have felt guilty about influencing a child into going (insert miserable field here). Maybe they were trying to get back a piece of the school days before cubicles replaced the playground. \n2. I am a nurse. And I have been told by coworkers, my superiors, my patients, and my patients' families that I am a good nurse, friendly, helpful, and that I do really care about people and their well being. This is all true. However, sometime between me graduating nursing school and starting to work, humanity really started to disappoint me...or, maybe the veil off my eyes was raised, and I saw a lot of the bullshit out there. Regardless, even though I totally don't feel like going to work tomorrow, I am because I am thankful to help people, I am thankful to have the opportunity to try and be nice to people and make difficult stuff a little easier.\n3. One of the toughest things for most people I have found is not the actual work but COWORKERS. Jeeeeesus. Remember those kids you had in your classes, those loud/stupid/obnxious/lazy kids who annoyed the hell out of everyone? The teachers were so happy when the semester/school year ended because that kid went to someone else. I was happy when the semester ended because I didn't have to deal with them anymore either. Well, the difference here is that 1)unless you have some sort of contract or rotating location/shift, there really isn't an end in sight for dealing with people who might be pretty difficult.  This leads me to my next thing: 1)you can not ever change your coworkers, 2)you can only change yourself, your attitude, and your job and 3)when you go to a new job, there will probably be someone there that is really annoying/lazy/smells bad. \n4. COWORKERS...again. One of the hardest but most rewarding part of work is that whole \"being a team player\" thing. I have three coworkers who are extremely helpful; we all generally work well together and we all help each other silently without bragging about how much help we are giving. We have one other coworker (yes, it is a small healthcare center, so there are five of us including me) who thinks that she is THE HARDEST WORKING PERSON EVER and constantly needs help, or if you are helping her, it isn't how she wants to be helped, or the exact way she felt like being helped. You will probably run into someone like this at a future job and they may make you consider jumping off a bridge, pushing them off a bridge, or quitting. Do none of these things, stick it out, and become numb to it. Learn from it. If laughing to yourself helps you cope, then do it, but you might get the rep as the crazy person who laughs to themself.\n5. Every job has a trade off. A lot of people can't stand to work in a cubicle so they get a physical job like nursing (we are on our feet a lot, running around, lifting patients, etc), working outdoors, whatever. The trade off is that you are possibly more prone to body pain, injuries, etc. If you get a cubicle job, sure, you can get injured, with things like carpal tunnel syndrome from too much reddit while you should be working away like a good little mouse. OR, you can get fat. \nLike I said, trade offs. A good motto I have found that works for me is \"balance.\"  I spend a part of my day at the computer doing some mandatory reports I have to do anyway, so I use that time to give my knees and back a break. Most of the rest of my day being a glorified waitress to my patients. \n6. Sometimes it is the little things about a job that can really make you hate it or love it. My job pays TERRIBLY. I am paid about $10 less per hour than other people with the same experience. However, we have a lot of vendors who come on site and they bring us free food (not always, sometimes, nom nom nom). Also, most nurses working in the hospitals here in Houston have to park in some off-site place and then shuttle in, or pay to park really close to the hospital in the giant parking garages; my job's parking lot is right next to our building and it is free. This is a BIG deal for me because it means I get to sleep in an hour extra each morning. So, like I said, little things can make it or break it for you. \nSorry for rambling, but I hope that I (as someone who has been a professional in the work force for about four years now) can provide you some insight. \n\n",

Say a company has been running RedHat 9.0 and now they want to move to RHEL 6. This is usually more than the regular admin wants to deal with. I get to look over their software  and data, build up a mgration plan, and then start moving their applications over. Because each business is different, it's always a unique challenge.\n\nIf by some chance, I'm dealing with a CEO or a manager, those requests are usually pretty simple (reboot the server, reset my password, etc). they're looking for a quick fix while their admin is on vacation. I work night shifts, so I usually get more of the technical on-call types (and interesting migration projects) than I do management types.\n\nThe rest of the time, I'm basically just sitting in a comfortable room with other admins and a big fat (100Mbps)  link to the Internet.

I was sort of nudged in a direction and I did what it took to make it happen.\n\nI got into wildland firefighting when I first went to college.  The state forest service would use college students for supplemental labor.  When I dropped out of school, I discovered that the only thing I knew how to do was fight fires, so I started working for the state part-time and spent my days off applying for full-time jobs all over the country.  I eventually landed a full time job on a prescribed burn crew in North Dakota, and just sort of bounced around the country from there.\n\nI learned to use a chainsaw, I had always been real outdoorsy, and I knew most of the trees in the forest, so when I moved back East to go back to school, I started getting jobs on forestry crews.  I worked a chainsaw, a lumbermill, and did a lot of hard grunt work for a long time.  Eventually I got a job with a small private company that did contracts with the federal forest service rehabilitating an area that had burned a few years ago.\n\nI cannot stress how hard I had to work to get and keep such a sweet gig.  I paid for it (in order of decreasing volume) in blood, sweat, and tears.  It was the best job I ever had.\n\nThe lab is just a temporary thing right now.

I got a fairly generic degree, Marketing, and did not have a clue what I wanted to do with it. My advice is to pursue broad industries that potentially interest you and try to get as many interviews, even if just informational, as possible. During the interview process you will meet actual people working in that industry, hear first hand what kinds of things you will be doing on a daily basis and see what kind of personalities/cultures those companies have. That process helped me narrow down to something I could connect with. My job is great because everyone is relatively young, you get to work with some of the coolest companies (from technology companies like Google/Facebook to big name publishers like New York Times, Wired, and everything in between). It is all about relationships so we get to go out and do extremely fun things like eat at the best restaurants in town, take trips places, party our faces off, etc. and it is all legitimately in the name of business. I manage a team of 20 somethings and it is very rewarding seeing younger people start brand new, begin to learn, and flourish as professionals. Initially I did not make a ton of money but through hard work and actually accepting that I love my job I was able to grow and now am approaching around $100k.

Well, maybe some of you will find my job interesting. :) I love my job, though the hours can get a bit long (mainly because there's too much fun stuff to work on). \n\nI work for Microsoft, and help game developers make their games better on all of our platforms (Xbox 360, WP7, and Windows). The job is being in the games industry without as much crunch time. I'll have to be fairly vague, as I deal with a lot of confidential IP... but there's a fair amount I can share:\n\nGame developers from around the world contact my team with concerns, or questions for clarification, or a need to speed up an algorithm, or any number of questions. I have contacts across several organizations that I can pull in if I need assistance, but for the most part we get to work out the customer's issue on my own terms. It *is* essentially a support role, but more like being an expert-on-demand (typically an asked question has gone through the Jr. Developer -&gt; Lead -&gt; Architect chain in the game company before coming to us).\n\nDevelopers will also come to Microsoft to do lab visits where we review their code. Occasionally we'll fly to them, and put on presentations/do code reviews/brainstorm. The group I'm in puts together GameFest, so I typically have a speaking position and review talk proposals for my track/coordinate the speakers/etc. In July I flew to London to give three talks, spent several days meeting developers across the UK, and later flew to Paris to meet another developer.\n\nWe also have a capacity to share the aggregated information from the game developers to the platform team, and get to sit in on planning sessions to share the game developer / users' perspectives. Helping to get solutions in place for real-world problems, or helping to define new functionality that will enable lateral-thinking niche titles, has been really rewarding. Not to mention the amazing stuff we get to work on, like helping developers understand the capabilities of the Kinect for its launch! \n\nI also create tools for our team to improve their productivity, and put together a weekly \"State of the Gaming Nation\" presentation for 20+ people so they know what's going on (new game trailers, strange news, what people are talking about, etc). \n\nOne of the best parts of the job is that everyone in the group is extremely intelligent. We've hired some very bright people. \n\nBefore this job, I've done...\n\n* Tools development for the developer division at Microsoft\n\n* Programmer writer for SQL Server for 5 years &lt;-- *agony*, mainly because I came here during the .COM bust, took a 60% pay cut, and didn't move on when I realized it was a poor fit. Leason learned: Suck it up if times are tough, but definitely be open to leaving sooner if it's obvious that the position is a poor fit.\n\n* Sr. Software Developer/Analyst consultant creating custom business line applications (Universal Studios, Best Western, Starwood, etc). I left this one because of the .COM bust...\n\n* I was a salaried developer consultant for a family-run consulting agency, which was not fun (the husband and wife managed relations with customers so poorly that they had to change the company name).\n\n* I was tech support &amp; network admin &amp; developer for a \"Low Cost Retail/Shareware Distributor\" company creating installs and maintaining their network.  &lt;- Easy going, and the most fun until I landed this current job.\n\n* High school.",

We're not making millions, but we do OK, with some nice growth plans on the horizon, and I'm definitely front and center.\n\nI like it for two reasons.  First, while a CFO, accounting is maybe 20% of my job.  I am in charge of legal, HR and facilities, and I also know enough tech to set up employees computers and reset the network in a pinch.  I am working on a fundraising round, and the company could certainly be sold in the next few years, which would be a great experience.  The variety keeps the job interesting for me.

I can also take an hour lunch and browse reddit during that time, like I am right now.\n\nSince I appreciate the flexibility, I also push everyone at the company to take advantage of it without crossing into abuse.  As long as we all get our work done, everything is good.  No one works massive hours, no long weekends - we treat the job as a job, and I try to push my own mantra onto my co-workers:  Work to Live, Don't Live to Work.\n\nI'm definitely fortunate to have a job I enjoy, especially in this economy, but this is also why I busted my back for 12 years to get to this level in my career:  so I could help to mold the company into one I would want to work for.",

English?  \"Foreign Languages\"?\n\nI don't work at my company any more, as I've decided to go back to school, but I'll answer your question as if I still worked there.  I worked for a small financial software consulting company that works with clients all over the world.  I initially wanted to work there because of the promise of working from home most of the time - and my goal at the time was to do as little work as possible and still pull the largest paycheck I could manage.\n\nThat's the way it started, anyway.\n\nMost of my days were spent either doing work on the projects I was assigned, working on my own personal projects, or fucking off playing WoW or browsing reddit.\n\nGiven the clients we had to deal with, in an average 40 hour week, I'd probably only have spent about 5 or 6 hours doing real, actual, work.  The rest of the time I was waiting for someone to give me information, waiting for the fucking thing to compile, or some combination of the two.\n\nI enjoyed my job very much, and what made it enjoyable was the relaxed work environment, friendly co-workers, and a comfortable environment.  There were only a dozen or so people in the entire company, so the main office was run out of the basement of a townhouse.  It's much more comfortable to shit in a bathroom of a house than shit in the bathroom of a large office building.\n\nI ended up working from home 1-4 days out of the week, and that (even just one day) was enough of a \"vacation\" to keep me sane.  Waking up at 8:45 for a 9:00 shift and getting to wear my underwear all day versus getting up at 7 for a 9:00 shift and having to drive all the way to work isn't really a comparison.",

I also get a window seat in the heart of downtown and see all the talented women that walk down the street everyday.\n\nI wouldn't say I actively \"enjoy\" my job, but I like the idea of getting paid to do things that I would be doing anyways.

    "c2p4h7y": "I am convinced that I hold two of the best jobs a college student can have. \n\nFirst, my primary job is a general labor/farm job. It offers me as many hours as I want up to 40 hours a week, and never asks twice when I say I need a day/weekend off for school. This job only hires college students because it is meant to be a transitory job, something we are supposed to learn from and move on. We do everything from picking weeds for hours on end, to cutting down trees, to hosting weddings and hoedowns. What I love most about this job is it is never the same work, on 180 acres, there is always something different to do. Additionally, I have learned more than most college students about how to work like a true man (digging, sweating, working on machinery, operating machinery, etc..) and how to bust ass and get stuff done. At the end of the day, I can look around the property and see what my work has accomplished, and that is one of the best feelings to me.\n\nSecond, I work in a sorority kitchen, waiting and busing tables, for a large state university. Although the true benefits of this can probably be assumed, I also do very little \"hard work\". We work 2 hours a night, get to eat lunch when we get there, get paid around 10/hr, and go home with a 4 star restaurant equivalent meal that is enough to feed 4. Having this food has helped me survive in college, you really can't put a price on good food. I also enjoy this job because everyone I work with have become good friends of mine, and they also work very well around my schedule.\n\nLet me also note that these jobs were found either through craigslist or the school news paper. I guess I got lucky.\n\nEdit: **tl;dr** I work on a farm and at a state college sorority kitchen",

Then figure out how to relate the things you did to complete your degree - even if the field is not related - to the duties and responsibilities of the job you are after.\n\nI majored in Music composition. So I could say that having to learn all the rules (music theory) for my degree helped me learn how to learn IT concepts. Music composition is creating something good based on the rules of the game. So is IT, you are creating/fixing something and in order to do that you need to understand how to apply the rules of each system to figure out what is going on and what will/won't work.\n\nFigure out how this applies for your major and the field you want to get into.

The bosses (brothers) were cool guys, easy to get along with; rarely did I feel under any pressure. Loved my coworker. We could just shoot the shit all damn day. I didn't mind working extra time because it was just like hanging out with friends. Plus the store contained a coffee shop too, so I could make myself as many free yummy drinks as I wanted to.

Talk about learning how to code for the worst case scenario. You mess up you effect somebody's pay.  Learning from people who knew what mistakes to avoid was awesome. \n\nNext up I was on the team in charge of over 10k unix servers. (Depending on the store configuration we would have 1-4 servers at the site.)  Learned how to coordinate massive rollouts. That and when people say it is only a 1% failure rate to smack the stupid out of their mouths.  1% failure rate is too high when it yields 100 or more down sites. \n\nRight now I am on a team in charge of rapidly responding to the turn on a dime request that come over from the business side of the house. Learning project management skills on managing expectations and fighting feature creep.  Not to mention the stuff we are coding are the quick wins that the business wants to prototype before investing more resources. I kinda get to see the future direction. \n\nWho knows but after this I might take a transfer and try to go work in a store as part of the management team. My wife who also works in the same IT division has been loving the international intergrations she has been working on. \n\nFind a large company that is a reasonable fit for you. Then bounce around as you need to so that you have to keep learning. Be a pleasant person to be around and learn how to not embarrass your team or manager.  IE. Dress and act the part of a good corporate worker.   Eventually you will earn a reputation as someone who can get shit done and you'll get the fun projects instead of the soul crushing ones. ",

Now, how this works is, you buy a license for a scanning station that's valid for (for instance) 2 million documents. Well, these guys were using this as a sort of performance metric, one of the bureaus had already used up 1.4 million (in a year or so, maybe 8-10 guys in total) and everyone was bummed out that the counter was reset to 0 with the new licenses, they have a sort of competition going of who could handle the most cases/burn through their quota the fastest (nothing official, just among themselves for shits and giggles).\n\nAnd my company has some nice perks, paid mobile phone (that I can use for private calls as much as I want), annual work hours (i.e. working whenever you want), bonuses dependent on a fixed revenue goal that's defined at the beginning of a year (and applies for everyone the same, even the CEO), mandatory/paid continuing education (of your choosing), regular company wide events (think company picknik, but everyone is driving quads through the mud) and so on.\n\nSo yeah, I really enjoy it.

    "c2p63zg": "I work as a Tier 1 IT help desk manager for an international engineering firm.  I've worked my way up from answering phones to leading a fantastic crew of about 50+ folks who support North America operations.  My team busts their humps on a daily basis, and my role is to make sure they have everything they need in order to continue to do so.  I receive a comfortable salary, work overtime when it's needed, and get decent benefits.\n\nAs you do your research, you may find a lot of folks who work in IT, hate working in IT.  Do a search here on Reddit alone, there's lots of posts about IT support angst; customers are idiots, bosses are jerks and they have no idea what I do, I work crap hours, I'm not appreciated, etc etc etc.  Some reading this may be thinking: \"This guy is a liar, nobody loves an IT job with this kinda crap.\"  I can tell you honestly, that I love my job.\n\nI hope I can share this following piece of wisdom with you:  It doesn't matter what field(s) you end up working in as it is your attitude will help to define your success.  You can work the most difficult job, with the most challenging people, and the most tedious task, but if you maintain a strong attitude and aim for the positive, doors will open up for you no matter where you are.\n\nTaking tasks with earnest enthusiasm will help lead to more learning and growth opportunities.  Not letting negative coworkers get you down, will help you to focus on what really needs your time and energy.  Respect that you have to earn your place, just like everyone else had to before you.  Being the sincerly eager, integrous, and positive human makes you stand out in the sea of those who would choose to wallow in their ideals of what the world owes them.\n\nNo job is perfect, as they're run by your fellow humans; we're passionate, driven, selfish, honorable, cruel, friendly, vindictive, supportive, jealous, concerned about their own problems, and altrustic.  Your satisfaction at a job is a two-way street.  You need to show that you're willing to help it grow, and they need to support in return.  \n\nSome jobs just aren't good places to be.  Some don't reciprocate and will drag you through the proverbial mire.  Don't allow yourself to be taken advantage of and fall into a rut.  Learn from the mistakes of yourself and others and make yourself stronger from that knowledge.  Then, when you're in your next hiring interview, focus only on those good things you learned of yourself and from watching others, and what you accomplished at your old job.  Having participated in the hiring process, I can say that you positive folks stand out like a beacon.  It makes us employers think:  \"This is the kind of person we want to hire.  We can see giving them opportunities.  We can see them moving up.  I can see them taking my job.  I can see this person doing great things!\"\n\nTo quote what you said in your post:  \"I'm actually pretty much convinced there is no such thing as a job I wouldn't hate.\"  Keep that attitude.  Hold onto it on the darkest and toughest days where you feel everything is going wrong.  Don't delude yourself that the rough days won't be there, but do know if you go into it with your head up, you'll find they're much easier to weather.\n\nDoesn't matter if you work for a lab which discovers the cure for AIDS, or if you gather trash from city parks, or if you work for a non-profit which finds homes for the homeless or if you flip burgers at McDonalds.  Everyone has to work their way up. Everyone has to find what they want to do.  Everyone usually has to work hard to get where they want to be.  Most folks will have the opportunity to be stepped on.  It's how you choose to face those challenges which will help you find value and satisfaction in whatever it is you end up doing.\n\nGood luck on whatever path you end up taking in life.\n",

I manage a shoe store whose target customer are teens and young adults. (think Vans, Converse, DC, Puma, Adidas, Polo etc). \n\nReasons I love my job:  \n1. I have no dress code. I can have crazy hair (had a 6 inch tall blue mohawk for a while) and visible piercings and tattoos.   \n2. I have very little paperwork to do. The company streamlines their reports so that managers, who SHOULD be the best salespeople in the store, can focus on sales and not be paper-pushers.  \n3. I'm VERY appreciated for my hard work. I have a great boss that pretty much lets me do my own thing since she knows she doesn't have to worry about me not doing my job right. Also the top managers of the company get sent to a week long conference (that feels more like a week long party) every year. Last year there were about 260 managers there. It's looking like this year there will be almost 500. They give you all kinds of gifts and great food.  \n4. 40% employee discount.  \n5. I actually like working in malls. I've done a lot of different type of jobs and always end back up in mall retail because I like the sense of community you have with other mall workers. Also I REALLY like to people-watch and I don't think there are any better places in America to do so than shopping malls. (Wal-mart people-watching is more like a train wreck)  \n6. My company promotes from within. 85% of my company's corporate people started out at the HIGHEST as store managers. My CEO was a *seasonal* part timer and now he's the President of a company with over 1200 stores (all 50 states, Puerto Rico and Canada).  \n7. No degree required to move up in MOST of the advancement opportunities. President/CEO doesn't have any degrees, and VP of sales has a degree in criminal justice.  \n\n\nThe whole company seems to me like a bunch of misfit kids that weren't sure what they wanted to be when they grew up until they found a home with us. That's how I felt, and finding my company was the only thing to give me any sort of direction in life.

By the time I was done with high school, my parents fully supported me to go to a great music school.  I stayed there for grad school, too, got a master's degree in music that I had to take out student loans for, and have made virtually no money off the degree itself!  But in school I made contacts that led to work, and now I support myself through my craft of choice.\n\nMy dad, the electrical engineer, was always incredibly supportive of my decision.

With this job i'm always somewhere different, doing a Wedding, or Bar Mitsvah. \n\nJust last weeked I worked in a Museum, a very popular one in a big city, a company rented out the entire place for a fucking **party**.

    "c2p6brm": "I love my job, but it's definitely not the kind of thing you could find everywhere - I work as a Production Technician at a Community TV station.  It's a three-part job - I teach the members of the station how to use all of our equipment (everything from camcorders to HD studio equipment to a mobile studio truck), I supervise members actually making TV programming, and I'm a graphics specialist for the station, both creating images in Photoshop, and transferring said images to Avid DEKO CG computers.\n\nI love my job for four reasons.  First, I love working in TV - I've been interested in a career in the field since I was 8, so working at a professional station is a dream come true.  \n\nSecond, the job is unique in the TV field because it allows me to do something different each day.  Many TV jobs are single-role positions - a cameraman will only use a camera, an editor will only edit, a CG guy will only work CG, etc.  I have both the skills and the freedom to choose which task I do each day, which keeps the job interesting.\n\nThird, the job stokes my need to support democracy and social justice.  Access Television is all about giving anyone in our region a voice through professional television equipment and skills.  The ability to bestow this knowledge onto others, and watch them obtain the power to more effectively communicate through the medium of video with our community is very gratifying.\n\nFinally, and this can come with any job, but I have an amazing boss.  Since our station is a non-for-profit, we don't make as much money as someone else in our field (though I make a respectable wage).  As a result, my boss makes certain that the staff get as many benefits and personal freedoms as is reasonable to run the station efficiently.\n\nAs a piece of advice to anyone who might be interested in this sort of thing, including our OP, I highly recommend getting involved with your local Access TV station (if you have one) as a volunteer.  It'll give you some important volunteer experience that looks good if you've not had a solid job for a while, and often Access Centers hire new staff from their dedicated volunteers...four of our seven staff here started out as volunteers in one way or another before becoming full-time staff.\n\n\nTL;DR  I help people make community TV, and I freaking love it.

Giving people from all walks of life a good time, an enriching experience - even sometimes a life-changing experience, cannot be underestimated. I drive home from work feeling like I have added something to the world, and made a difference.\n\n2: Be out doors! I have had office jobs in the past, while I was flittering away my youth trying to discover my vocational 'place' in society.\n\nI have learnt SO much in my occupation. I strike up conversation with people from such varied backgrounds ... neuro-surgeons, to plumbers, to youth-at-risk teens, international travellers, the whole gamut. I've been able to glean perspectives from many people that without my line of work, I simply would not have had the chance to meet or interact with.\nLike you, I attended college and drifted through. My advice, to put succinctly, would be to find something you have a passion for, something you enjoy. I was lucky enough to join the university rock-climbing club, and everything went from there for me. Don't let yourself be satisfied with a mediocre and miserable job; I've seen what this can do to people. Everyone is different. My partner is an engineer, and he loves his work, but in his place I wouldn't like it at all. Don't let other people tell you what's appropriate. It's not too lofty a goal to hold a job that is both enjoyable and allows you to make a living. This thread is proof there are many people in that place. \n",

My senior year in school, a friend got me in to a temporary job on set and, even though I had absolutely no experience, I went for it, and ended up with the beginnings of a career in the industry.  It was very surreal being in college but then taking off to do work out of state and with companies that I'd seen on TV all the time and in really outrageously cool places.

It's truly interesting what doors open up when you pursue this path, and while I may not have settled on one specific career just yet (even in mid-20s), I'm paying the bills and making a lot more than (I would assume) most recent college graduates (particularly as so many are completely unemployed or only making minimum wage), plus I enjoy the things I *do* a lot more (which generally equates to having a professional attitude that ultimately gets me quite a lot of jobs).  There's a lot out there and life is short, so unless you're in some dire condition (sole provider for family with sick/unemployed parents, etc), I would have as much fun playing around and trying out everything before you're in your 60s and people just think it's weird because they assume you're having a mid-life crisis.",

I think it's because everybody likes to go to the movies, but not many people know much about how the films are actually presented.\n\nIt's cool being in the booth on the 4th floor, on a cold, rainy day, because it's really warm in there from the projector bulbs. We have open air windows, I can peer out onto the street as the rain comes down.\n\nMy coworkers are all really awesome; they're the kind of people I'd hang out with outside of a work setting, and I often do.

It pays more than enough to cover rent and the bills, and I only work ~30 hours a week, so that gives me plenty of free time to spend hours cycling on a work day, or to go to any movie for free while I'm not working (my favorite perk.)\n\nI know it won't last, I can't stay in this town for more than another year without getting sucked in and never leaving, and I want to move on to bigger and better things.

I'm completely in charge of the activities- I construct the calendar every month, facilitate all the activity groups, schedule entertainment, hire and schedule volunteers, and do 4 or 5 different types of documentation on a monthly and daily basis.\n\nI have my BA in psychology, and I'm trying to get some experience in the field before going to grad school to pursue my PsyD in clinical psychology. My undergrad GPA sucks, so hopefully having the experience will help me get into an okay school sometime next fall. There isn't much you can do psychology-wise with just a BA, and the job market is extremely saturated right now. I worked overnights at a group home for 2 months (the schedule was hell), and then was unemployed for 5 months before finding this job. I only got it because I reminded my boss of herself a little and she took a chance on me.\n\nI make $12 an hour, and it's not nearly enough to pay the bills or even begin thinking about paying back my student loans. I also live in Orange County in Southern California where the cost of living is absurd. I've thought a lot about finding a better paying job but 1) they're not really out there, 2) I'm not the best qualified, and  3) I enjoy my job and would rather have the experience on my grad school application. No one works with seniors for the money, I can tell you that- and especially with all the bullshit MediCare cuts California is going through right now times are extremely tough and things are very very tight. I'm busy every minute of every day at work and I'm always behind because there's so much I have to do. I'm grossly underpaid for how hard I work, but it is what it is. I still love it though because it's so rewarding. It's an incredible feeling knowing that you have a direct impact on someone's quality of life when there's not much left, and it's so heartwarming when a gentleman with Alzheimer's tells you that he had fun today and a good day, or when many participants thank you for what you're doing for them and that you do a good job.",

This current generation of young people is fascinating--albeit occasionally frustrating.\n\nAnd finally, I might get paid a pittance, but there remains a glimmer of hope that in many years, eventually I'll have a nice office, a respectable salary, and the freedom to (almost) completely control my research agenda. I could never sit in an office and run someone else's statistics. My work may be underpaid right now, but at least I never have a boring workday.

After it's all spec'ed out, you code it and test it, similarly to a software design project.  After it's been simulated to some degree, you sometimes get to prototype it in a lab.  After coding so much and testing in simulation, it's great fun to get in the lab and hook up your prototype to real-world devices and machines (PCs, telecom equipment, video cards, etc. depending on the chip I was working on).

Both are nerds through and through, and have had a hand in my future career choice and college education. \n\nAlso, it helps that I'm currently sitting in one of my bosses' office, playing around with different setups on a test computer, while browsing reddit. I don't have a car, but I no longer mind waiting 2+ hours for a ride because I can just go over to his office and try to make different adapters out of other adapters.\n\nBest internship without the internship part ever.",
