Being accepted for his internship will be (hopefully) one of the best things for me if I wish to pursue a career in hockey. He has an incredible amount of connections and prior interns of his now have jobs such as full time play-by-play commentators (what I hope to do someday), assistants for league head officials, and are employed in many other facets of the National Hockey League. \n\nSince it is still the summer (and a lockout is currently looming) there is not much going on aside from editing and writing for the weekly newsletter he puts out, as well as writing for other publications that have since added me as a contributor and my own personal hockey blog that I hope will grow in time.  However, once the season (hopefully) starts, I will be covering New Jersey Devils games with him and while it will be difficult to put my fandom aside (I care more about the Devils than most other things in my life) I know being in the press box for games will open me up to meeting many people who currently work in the sport and build connections for the future. \n\nSince beginning this internship, I have been published multiple times including on his hockey newsletter, various hockey websites, and a Boston Bruins book that will be coming out in November. These are some of my greatest accomplishments so far as a 22-year-old and I truly feel that this internship will be the best stepping stone for me to get involved in hockey as a career one day soon.",

I primarily assist refugees.\n\nI love what I do bc it satisfies my soul, for lack of a better phrase.  I am not paid in accordance to the private rates for my services, but I am in a position to help people who could not get help anywhere else - I can help people bc it is the right thing to do and that means justice in its truest form to me (money SHOULD not be the difference and all too often it is - projects like ours and other non-profit law firms level the playing field by representing those who need/deserve representation but could never afford it).  I value the services my project provides so much that when budget cuts threatened them and my position, I fundraised in my spare time to save those services provided through my position.  It might have been easier to get a job in private practice or in a city with better support of public services, but that would not have helped my city, my community, my clients - that did not seem like the right thing to do and I could not abandon my project and my clients without a fight (I got lucky and got donations sufficient to keep us going through the  hard times, which aren't over).\n\nI am constantly overwhelmed with work, bombarded with tough, painful stories, always tired, and always trying to get more involved.  I love it bc my clients remind me of my family, immigrants.  My clients are the original American Dream.  My work helps put them in a position to accomplish that goal.  My clients remind me of what is important in life and what are merely games you just have to stop playing, grow up, and focus on the things you do that make a difference in the lives of others - bc that is what is mostimportant; it us hard to concern yourself/waste your time with petty things and petty/hateful people when you have so many stark reminders of the reality and beauty of life. My clients remind me of the value of holding a loved one in your arms after years apart and in fear.  My clients, their stories, their pain, their joys...they keep me grounded, motivate me to be as positive and smile as much as they do despite all they've been through.  I see our future in my clients and their children.  I see future entrepreneurs, future scientists, future professionals, and a more promising future for our country in every respect bc they are here.  I am proud and humbled to be a part of that.

I started in cancer, went to level 1 trauma and now work in a generic, pediatric ER.  \n\nWhat I love about my job is that I am well paid.  I make a stupid amount of money.  \n\nI love that I help not only children but also parents.  I am able to teach them that what they think is a fearful issue regarding their kid is really not so bad.  It pleases me that I am able to do that in a non condescending way.  I love it when I get a handshake and a \"thank you\" from the parents.  I love it ten times more when the child thanks me as well.\n\nI love the fact that I work 3 days a week and can do pretty much what I want on my 4 days off EVERY week!  I have seen more of our world in the past 5 years than most people will see in a life time.  \n\nI love that I am able to communicate effectively with most parents in how to deal with heath issues regarding their kids.  I love the fact that I went to great lengths to learn Spanish to be able to communicate with the parents of roughly half the kids I deal with.  It was a royal pain in the ass.  But that effort paid off.  \n\nI love the fact that I have eased many a child's way to death when that was all I could do and comforted the family afterwards.  I love that on occasion, I have had a hand in turning a dreadful diagnosis into a positive outcome.  I would take that over scoring the winning touchdown in a Super Bowl.  \n\nI love the fact that even at age 46, I am still the \"go to\" person when things are going bad.  I can calmly and effectively run a code.  I can get an IV in a dead kid.  I can say, \"she is not dead yet\", be listened too and continue interventions without question.  I can respectfully steer doctors in a group setting to ordering more appropriate interventions without them feeling I was being disrespectful or calling them out.  \n\nI love being a man in a female dominated profession.  Having a penis means I don't have to deal with the pointless intergender warfare that so many women I work with have to deal with.  ALL THE TIME!\n\nI love the fact that when a new grad nurse is hired, I am usually the one who gets to train her.  That is a HUGE thing, a huge impact I get to have on a new professional.  I do not dog my charges.  I also do not coddle them.  But I do get to impart part of myself upon them.  It's cool to me because they might well take care of me when I am at their mercy when I am an old man later on.    \n\nI was a policeman in the military for 4 years.  After that, I worked my way up to Executive Chef at a 4 star hotel where I worked for 10 years.  I have helped in domestic violence issues.  I have popped my share of beyond wasted drivers.  I have made more wedding dreams come true than I can count.  I have helped make millionaires even more millions.  \n\nBut what I love most in my job is the occasional, spontaneous and unasked for high five from a feeling better 4 year old, who a few hours earlier came in feeling like 4 year old crap.  \n\nI will take that feeling over everything else I have ever experienced on a professional level.

To me it's not about \"selling\" stuff people don't need but solving peoples problems.  There is nothing better than walking out with a customer to do a demo on a system we just finished and they have not yet heard or in most cases paid for yet.  Before we started the install i request of that customer  either a favorite song/album/CD that they most enjoy.  So, when they sit in the drivers seat i try to have that particular song on pause ready to go and than i hit \"play\" and watch for their reaction.  You can tell when you \"crushed\" it and they light up like a porch light.  Have had so many truly heartwarming experiences over the years that I still get stoked when a customer hands me over his keys.  On that same note, like everything else in life nothing is trouble free or works forever and so it is with car audio.  Lot's of times customers will come in with problems and issues that we can solve that they have put up with for years and finally will stop by to see what can be done?  It's so funny when they take you out to their car and describe the problem and turns out to be something like the balance or fader set wrong, don't know how to set the damn clock or the amp went from playing bass to now just voice and all it was was a button got moved.

There are little brats, some of the kids feel entitled like I can't explain, and we have a fair share of socially handicapped kids and ADD/ADHD-kids, but 95% of these kids are little rays of sunshine.

My pay is even better than any other salary I've received before. My hours fit perfectly into my rather tight schedule of university classes and my own music and all the other things I like doing.

But I'm still relatively young (28), so I don't think it'll be a problem.\n\nI decided to say yes to the second job (I was called up and asked if I wanted it, out of the blue) because I've just sold my apartment and I'm trying to save up some more money to buy maybe a house.\n\nDriving a cab is awesome, I'm my own boss, do whatever I want, and I get to meet a bunch of interesting (and some uninteresting) people. In the weekends I drive drunk people to parties, out to bars and home again, which can be either really fun or really annoying (if they're really loud, obnoxious, or in worst cases, throw up).\n\nWith both my jobs I will be making about $7000-8500 per month, so I guess putting money aside won't be much of a problem. :)",

You also need to understand how the machines have to be started up and shutdown in what order, what potential problems require an immediate shutdown, what don't. The goal is to automate everything as much as possible to ensure not only efficiency but also safety. \n\nSo my company gets the controllers and figures out the programing. I then get sent to wherever the site is (it can be anywhere in the world) and basically install the equipment, test run everything, and supervise/train the workforce on site to make sure everything is working properly. \n\nIts a lot of challenges, a lot of work, but I get to see the world. I make pretty good money, and it wasn't really what I was expecting out of college (I am a mechanical engineer but this is more typically an electrical engineer). \n\nIt can get difficult at times. I have had situations where my local housing was less than...what one would desire. I also consistently run into the annoying event that no matter where I am in the world, the guys I am working with want to take me to a restaurant that they think I would like as opposed to local food. If I wanted American food, I would have gotten a job over here. The hours can also be rather long and often times, I am the only face of my company that the plant owners see. So any issue, I get to face the anger, whether or not I can control anything. \n\nBut I really like my job. ",

Having tea tasting, discussing flavor profiles, educating ourselves on the process of the tea, where it comes from, why it tastes like it does, etc.\n\nAnother part of my job is to romanticize the tea room - light incenses, candles, etc. It's fucking beautiful.\n\nWhen I'm working, I can drink all the tea I want; we listen to all sorts of music (thank you Spotify) and we have a diverse customer basis.

    "c63qd78": "I'm a high school teacher, second year out. Freaking love my job. Sure there are shit days, the pay isn't the most amazing in the world, but I get to pass on knowledge about topics I love - I essentially get to talk about my favourite things all day. I also get amazing holidays (they do get taken up with a lot of planning, but after 10 weeks of teaching you really do need time out from kids, so they're hella good for that reason). \nThe moment when you have been trying and trying and trying to get a concept across to a kid and it finally clicks - best feeling ever. Also when a kid thanks you, or says you've helped them, it's incredibly satisfying. Right now, I can't think of anything else I'd rather be doing to earn money. ", 
    "c63q4h8": "I love my job. I set up a games studio in January this year. We called ourselves Glitch Games (because why not?) and then proceeded to make mobile apps for iOS, android etc. \n\nWe rented a small little office and moved every piece of electrical equipment we own into the building. We have shelves full of gaming consoles, ranging from the NES to the PS3. Beside the consoles sits a 52\" television so that we can play video-games all day and every day right? Wrong! Since we set up in January we have played these consoles once, and that was on a drunken night in the office after consuming many pizza slices and rum. \n\nMy point is; although we have so many amazing distractions and procrastination tools at our disposal, we love our work so much that we have sometimes worked 90 hour weeks and not even noticed. \n\nI think the key is that we have 100% creative control on the apps we make and because of this we are basically making our own dreams a reality. \n\nWe are by no means a successful company even though our latest app: 'BLOX' has had very positive reviews since it was released 2 weeks ago. I think the main reason we continue driving hard despite relatively minimal return is because we love our jobs so much that we want to make it the last job we ever work. This is not a bad frame of mind because it keeps us pushing harder and when we see the profits slowly snowball each month it just makes us love our jobs even more. \n\nI'm sorry to ramble on, and for any grammatical errors but I have no time to add brevity because I must get back to work. :)\n\nIf anyone would like to see what we have been working on the last 6 months then please look here:\n\nhttp://forums.toucharcade.com/showthread.php?threadid=140910\n",
