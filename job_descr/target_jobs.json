Their skills are in demand in a wide range of sectors; many graduate accountants work in public practice firms, but accountants may also be employed by the private, commercial, and not-for-profit sectors. The work of certified accountants entails:\nThe role tends to be office-based, although audit work often requires graduate certified accountants to visit client premises. Such visits may necessitate stays away from home that range in duration from one night to several weeks. While working hours tend to last from nine to five, longer hours may be common around peak times and in some sectors within commerce and the financial sector. Despite this, flexible working hours, job sharing and opportunities to work from home are often available, and the profession generally provides a good level of job security, remuneration and intellectual stimulation. Due to the high international regard for the profession and for accountancy qualifications, secondments and transfers abroad are possible, and are increasingly common within larger multinational corporations.\nMost vacancies arise in major towns and cities. Competition is most  severe for training places with large organisations. For these, early  applications, relevant research and previous business/accountancy  experience can help to secure a place. Lists of training vacancies are  available from qualification providers, such as the Association of  Chartered and Certified Accountants (ACCA). Opportunities are also  advertised by careers services, in national newspapers and in relevant  publications such as Accountancy Age, ACCA's newsletter, TARGETjobs City and Finance, and the Accounting and Business journal. ACCA also publishes a list of organisations that run approved training schemes.\nCertified accountants are required to undertake professional accountancy qualifications,which are provided by a number of professional bodies, including ACCA. These qualifications normally include studying for accountancy exams, an assessment of professional ethical judgement, and a supervised period of relevant work experience with an approved employer.\nWhile it is possible to study independently, many graduates prefer to secure training contracts with firms who sponsor their professional studies and allow them to complete the work experience requirement of the accountancy qualification. Graduates must normally complete three years of relevant work experience, but in some cases previous experience from internships may be counted toward this. Qualification allows graduate accountants to practice in a wide range of areas, and to identify themselves as a member of a professional accountancy body. Although the training period can be demanding, once qualified, membership reflects the professional standard of an individual's training, and that the quality of their work and expertise can be trusted. It also opens the door to speedy career progression, and many graduate accountants' salaries double shortly after qualification.\nQualification normally takes three years. The minimum academic requirements for entry are two GCSEs (grades A-C, including English and Maths) and two A-Levels (or the equivalent). Graduates of all disciplines may train as certified accountants, but those who have previously studied accounting, finance, or business-related subjects may gain exemptions from some exams. Larger employers expect a good record of academic achievement, and will often ask for 260 - 300 UCAS points and a first or 2.1 degree.\nCertain organisations may also prefer graduates to gain chartered status; this is particularly relevant to graduates who want to work internationally. Many larger employers also offer internships and work experience programmes, which can be useful in gaining insight and as evidence of interest in accountancy when graduates apply for training schemes. The Certificate in Finance, Accounting and Business (CFAB) can be taken during university holidays, and is another useful way of gaining knowledge and demonstrating interest.\nWhile technical abilities are obviously vital, accountants are expected to take a more strategic role in the future.

If these modules have not been covered by an applicant\u2019s law degree, then once matriculated, these can be sat through Faculty examinations.\nThe first step towards Bar-specific training is to gain a traineeship with a solicitors\u2019 firm. The Faculty of Advocates stipulates a minimum of 21 consecutive months spent at this stage. Following the traineeship, intrants must pass the Faculty\u2019s entrance exam before commencing the next stage of qualification. \nNow starts the apprenticeship period known as \u2018devilling\u2019.

At the same time you will attend skills training courses. This is full-time, unpaid work. You will need to make sure you have the resources to fund yourself for almost ten months.\n\nAfter final exams you will be admitted as an advocate and will be able to represent clients in court.

Typical employers | Qualifications and training | Key skills\nBarristers are legal professionals who provide advocacy and legal advice to solicitors and other clients. Solicitors are the first port of call for members of the public requiring legal advice. If a court appearence is required the individual will then be referred to a barrister who will provide court representation and specialist counsel depending on the nature of the case. \nThe path to becoming a qualified barrister is long and expensive but the payoff is a challenging, professional career, characterised by its variety and financial security.\nTypical work duties include:\nLong hours, heavy workloads and tight deadlines are very common. Barristers and would-be barristers are expected to put a lot of hard work into their cases, which can mean sacrificing their spare time to complete documents and research.\nOverall salaries vary widely and depend on the cases barristers take on and the fields they work in.\nDuring pupillage, pupils are paid a minimum of \u00a310,000 for twelve months; however, pupillage awards vary massively depending on the type of chambers in question with some in the region of \u00a335,000 or \u00a340,000.\nWith training, experience and reputation qualified barristers can earn anything between \u00a325,000 and \u00a3500,000. The onus to shape one's career and earn those high salaries is very much on the individual barrister. Those who 'take silk' and become Queen's Counsels can expect considerably higher wages thanks to the high profile and important cases they can take on.\u00a0\nQualifiying as a barrister consists of three stages: academic, vocational and apprenticeship (or pupillage).\nAt the academic stage graduates need at least a 2:2 in law or in any other subject supplemented by the common professional examination (CPE) or a graduate diploma of law (GDL). In fact most chambers expect graduates to have achieved at 2:1. While a 2:2 is acceptable it will require extra effort to prove your case; be aware that it will almost certainly leave you at a disadvantage.\nSome graduates take a masters which can help to boost your CV, but it is in no way essential. Gaining relevant experience is of far greater importance at this stage. It's recommended that students gain a mini-pupillage and as much understanding of the law as possible during their time at university. They should also be applying for their professional training, and their pupillage via the Pupillage Portal website, during their final year.\nThe Bar Professional Training Course (BPTC) is the vocational stage, and consists of a year of full-time study at one of eleven institutions across the country. The BPTC is an academcially intense, skills-based course that prepares graduates for pupillage and lays the foundations for future practice. You will have to join one of the four Inns of Court to do your BPTC. On completion of the course, having passed twelve qualifying sessions, you will be 'called to the Bar' \u2013 the legal equivilent of graduation.\u00a0\nThe final stage in becoming a fully-fledged barrister is the completion of pupillage. This consists of two six-month periods spent in chambers under the supervision of one or more 'pupil supervisors'. During the first six months pupils shadow and assist their supervisors; during the second six they may have the chance to take on small cases by themselves. It is possible either to spend all twelve months at the same chambers or to complete the two six-month periods in different chambers.\nOnce you have completed pupillage you need to find a permanent base from which to practise, known as a tenancy. You may be offered tenancy in the chambers in which you did the pupillage - however, not all pupils are this lucky so be prepared to look and apply elsewhere.\nBarristers need to demonstrate:\nThe best possible start to your career\nA website from GTI Media\n\u00a92014 GTI Media Ltd.

Each level takes approximately one year to complete, however, the use of computer based assessments and flexibile study options (full-time, part-time or distance learning) means that students can progress through the course at their own pace, rather than according to a strict exam schedule. Students start at the level appropriate to their prior knowledge, study and experience; for graduates, this is often at technician level. The AAT website has an online test that indicates the suitable starting level. Completion of the qualification allows accounting technicians to apply for membership of the AAT (MAAT), which indicates professional expertise and a commitment to maintaining it.\nCAT status is awarded by ACCA\u00a0upon completing one year of relevant supervised work experience, and demonstrating a level of professional competency based upon this. Unless students actively choose to opt out, they are automatically transferred to the ACCA qualification register upon gaining CAT status. This avoids the need for further forms and fees involved in continuing accountancy education.\nWhether pursuing the AAT or CAT qualification, prior knowledge or experience of accounting and maths is useful but not essential. While exemptions from parts of these qualifications may be granted according to previous knowledge or study, they in turn offer exemptions from certain university degrees in finance and accounting courses. Both qualifications are widely recognised by employers and professional bodies, and are often used as an alternative route to qualifying as a chartered accountant (CA). The experience gained at CAT level may be counted toward ACCA's work experience requirement for CA\u00a0qualification.\nEmployers look for evidence of:\nAn understanding of business practices gained through work experience may be helpful.\nThe best possible start to your career\nA website from GTI Media\n\u00a92014 GTI Media Ltd.

Typical employers | Qualifications and training | Key skills\nTaxation accountants are concerned with interpreting and explaining taxation legislation to a wide variety of clients. Changes in the annual Budget and recent court decisions mean that tax law is constantly evolving. Chartered tax accountants must therefore keep abreast of legislative developments and continually review their technical knowledge in order to advise clients of efficient tax compliance, and in order to understand the implications of financial actions. Typical activities include:\nTraining contracts normally encourage graduates to specialise in a particular branch of tax, such as corporate, international, personal or indirect tax. Specialisation in tax issues as they apply to a particular industry is also common. It is equally possible to develop a niche area of expertise, or to operate in a wider range of specialist areas of tax.\nThe role is predominantly office based, and can involve much contact with clients and colleagues. Hours tend to be regular, although longer hours may be required at peak times and can be particularly demanding in the run up to 31 January, the annual deadline for filing tax returns.\nTraining contracts are available annually, with large organisations such as the HMRC and the 'Big Four', down to smaller private firms. Competition for these is strong, but early applications, relevant research and previous experience can help to secure a place. Vacancies are advertised by careers services, recruitment agencies and in national newspapers such as The Financial Times, and specialist publications such as TARGETjobs City & Finance, Accountancy, Accountancy Age, Taxation and Tax Practitioner. The professional institutes also regularly produce lists of vacancies.\nTax has an effect on every member and area of society, and consequently it is possible to work within almost any sphere of personal interest. Self employment is a very feasible option, while many organisations employ in-house tax specialists. Typical employers include:\nGraduates from any background can train as taxation accountants, although all applicants should have an excellent record of academic achievement. Typical requirements include five GCSEs (grades A-C, with maths and English being essential), 220 UCAS points at A level, and a strong honours degree (2.2 or above). Be aware, however, that employers may ask for a higher UCAS score and degree classification. Previous experience is unnecessary, although formal vacation courses, workshops and placements can give a useful insight into the profession and reflect well upon applicants' knowledge and motivation to enter the sector. Previous academic study and qualifications in accounting, financial and legal areas may earn exemptions from formal CTA qualification (see below).\nChartered tax accountants in the UK\u00a0tend to train toward qualification as a chartered tax adviser (CTA), as recognised by the Chartered Institute of Taxation (CIOT). This typically involves 12 months or more of study toward professional exams and a relevant work experience requirement, after which point CTA students may apply for membership of CIOT. CTA qualification and subsequent CIOT membership indicates the highest level of expertise in UK tax, and carries a level of prestige that is recognised with excellent prospects for progression and remuneration. Membership is maintained by achieving a minimum of 90 hours of continuing professional development (CPD) each year.\nGraduates attain eligibility to take the CTA qualification through academic and professional study. The most common routes are either through achieving membership of the Association of Taxation Technicians (ATT), or qualification as a chartered accountant with a professional body such as ICAEW or ICAS. The former requires two years of relevant professional experience, while the latter requires three years and is a particularly useful route for graduates who wish to work in corporate tax. Graduates who have qualified as a solicitor, barrister or advocate may also train for the CTA qualification. Qualification as an Associate of the Institute of Indirect Taxation (AIIT) is an alternative and also highly regarded route. The Advanced Diploma in International Taxation (ADIT) is another alternative prerequisite for CTA study, but can also be a useful further qualification for CTAs wishing to work internationally and in corporate tax.\nWhile numerical and analytical skills are crucial, the role demands a high level of responsibility and reflection. The ability to communicate well is also vital. The following traits are highly valued:\nThe best possible start to your career\nA website from GTI Media\n\u00a92014 GTI Media Ltd.
